> I only want to do some additional explanations to david. It makes nothing with original patch.

Stop this TOP POSTING, it's bad etiquette on a technical mailing list.

Look at how other people write their email responses on this mailing
list.  They first provide a quoted portion of what they are replying
to:

> Quoted
> something like this.

And then they provide their response UNDERNEATH.

When you provide your response at the top of the email, it is unexpected,
and makes more work for people reading what you write.

You guys are doing everything possibly wrong.

You have unnecessarily quoted a HUGE patch just to provide some ancillary
in formation.

You are TOP POSTING.

You added a signoff of someone who did not give you explicit permission
to do so.

And you seem to not comprehend nor care about the implications or effects
of your actions that are hurting other people and creating a huge brudon.

I very much intend to simply ignore your work completely until you can
get your act in gear, write proper emails, and submit patches
properly.

It is the only deterrant I have for your incredibly rude and
inconsiderate behavior.
