I tried upgrading directly  from 3.2.5 -> 3.4.4.  Had two probs 
(the one mentioned in this email, and inability to set MTU size
on the other card under 3.4.4).  So, I thought to break it down --
first upgrading to current 3.2 (.22 at the time), then 3.3.6, 
and then 3.4.4.  

First was went to 3.2.22, which works (running it now) 

Then I tried 3.3.6 -- ethernet related messages from bootlog are below 
-- you can it finds the broadcom NetXtremeII cards and udev renames 
the devs back according to it's rules, but NETRTLINK isn't seeing it.

These rename actions are the same under the current kernel and
stem from trying to keep device names constant over years of
HW changes -- i.e. they are normal

Note -- "ip link" lists the interface as "down" w/no address.. but try 
bringing it up:     NTRTLINK says interface not found...?

Any ideas on what might be causing this?  I've combed over the options in
config(xconfig) at least 4 times now in detail and have tried variations
but don't see anything that could be causing this -- near as I can tell,
I'm booting with nearest config to my current as the new config allows.

But NTRTLINK isn't seeing the device?

Ideas?  From the date of the driver it doesn't look like it has been 
changed recently.

It's not good that the Intel card can no longer have it's packet size 
set in 3.4 (i.e. network problems trending "worse")....

thanks,
