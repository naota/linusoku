True.  Your set of patches isn't quite as likely to malfunction as it
looked at first glance.  It requires address reuse which happens accross
namespaces but not too frequently.

As for validating the socket namespace I agree that is the fix and my
patchset winds up doing it.

It takes a lot of associtations to exhaust the id space, but I have no
fundamental problems problems with the id allocation being per
namespace.  I had actually overlooked the local association id when I
did my patches.   After looking it became clear that making the
association id global was not necessary so I left it.

The sctp association id is a strange beast.  My personal inclination is
that the sctp association id really ought to be per sctp socket, but I
have not looked enough at the sctp userspace API to see if that works in
practice.  Shrug.

Mostly I am in favor of simple and correct.

Eric
