Hi Mark,

I am not testing the da9052 driver, but the da9058 that I recently submitted.

The problem is that the auto allocated "irq_base" comes back as zero.

I repeat - in v3.4 the daa9058 driver work, but fails (without my patch) in v3.5

If my suggested fix is not acceptable, then is it possible to fix the bug in some other way?

thanks,

Tony Olech

Please pay MORE attention to the changelog - obviously there's no problem mapping automatically allocated IRQs, there's only any effect if they happen to GET allocated at zero.

The only real issue I see with the current code is that if the user explicitly wants to statically allocate an IRQ range at zero they can't.
The current intended behaviour is that we use a linear domain unless a positive IRQ base is specified, though we're not quite doing that right now as a transitional measure until drivers are updated.

The current da9052 driver usage seems to have quite a few problems, I do recall having to fix some problems that make me doubt if it ever worked well.  Looking at the code now I see it's using hard coded references to absolute IRQ numbers which is an issue...  It should be being converted to use regmap_irq_get_virq().
