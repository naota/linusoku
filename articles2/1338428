It's three processors AMP SoC, the first powered on processors runs
 an RTOS and boots up the other two which run linux.

Yes, I'm using rpmsg.
And actually the remoteproc provides a good abstraction and the generic
facilities sysfs/debugfs handling, resource format, vring allocation, etc...
And the start/stop/kick API also serves as good place for handshaking
with the remote processors. Overall, most of the framework works well with
our platform, and the difference can be hidden in the platform priv
data structure.

Agree.
The patch may not solve this, but it should address some issues I'm having.

Yes, that's the point.

The format issue has been addressed by the fw format handler.
But we still need to address where the data come from.
Even it is in ELF format, it may not necessarily come from root file system.
It can be loaded from MTD partition or constructed/derived from the cmdline.

Actually, I've been using the this approach for the past few weeks.
I forged an ELF file containing the resource table, and dummy loadable
sections, otherwise it  failed the sanity checks. Until yesterday I merged
and found the fw format handler support in v3.6-rc1, and wondered if we
can just extend it a little bit to not load (bypass) the firmware at all.

That's what I'm trying to do, and it has two things needs to be address.

  1)  Make the firmware loading step "optional" in the booting process.

  2)  Allow the remoteproc use an customized handler to get the resource table.

Thanks,
