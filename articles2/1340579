Yes. At least, one hopes they fell back to order-0.

Your question is difficult to parse but I think you are making an implicit
assumption that it's the same caller retrying the high order allocation.
That is not the case, not do I want it to be because that would be similar
to the caller using __GFP_REPEAT. Retrying with more reclaim until the
allocation succeeds would both stall and reclaim excessively.

The intention is that an allocation can fail but each subsequent attempt will
try harder until there is success. Each allocation request does a portion
of the necessary work to spread the cost between multiple requests. Take
THP for example where there is a constant request for THP allocations
for whatever reason (heavy fork workload, large buffer allocation being
populated etc.). Some of those allocations fail but if they do, future
THP requests will reclaim more pages. When compaction resumes again, it
will be more likely to succeed and compact_defer_shift gets reset. In the
specific case of THP there will be allocations that fail but khugepaged
will promote them later if the process is long-lived.
