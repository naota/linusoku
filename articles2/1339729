Let me rephrase the previous statement, as it appears you did not 
understand what I meant.

If the kernel is testing for "on" or "off", what should it do when the
user writes "onoff"?  The kernel could accept this as meaning the same
as "on", but if the kernel was being careful then it should reject
"onoff" as a meaningless value.  A 2-byte comparison for "on" would
accept "onoff" whereas a 3-byte comparison would not.
