Hm, this sounds eerily familiar to the backlight bug you've recently fixed in

commit 6db65cbb941f9d433659bdad02b307f6d94465df

    drm/i915: Fix eDP blank screen after S3 resume on HP desktops

Have you checked other code-paths for such issues? The resume code
seems to follow this order already ... also, when you submit this
patch, can you please add a small comment to explain the ordering
constraint, like in the resume register restore function?

Thanks, Daniel
