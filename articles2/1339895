Your patch increases the number of pages to be reclaimed with considering
the number of fail case during deferring period and your test proved it's
really good. Without your patch, why can't VM reclaim enough pages?
Other processes steal the pages reclaimed?
Why I ask a question is that I want to know what's the problem at current
VM.
