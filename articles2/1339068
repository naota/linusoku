I found the option to quote/indent the email original, sorry about that but we
are forced to use Microsoft Outlook and the default were set up strangely.

I am trying to use the latest REGMAP API, and I do not understand why you
say the DSA9058 driver "requires" a dynamically allocated legacy domain.
Surely the virtual IRQs that the PMIC component drivers use must be
dynamically allocated. It is only the single GPIO line designated as an
interrupt line in the machne drivert that is fixed by the hardware. That
surely means the "irq_base" parameter to regmap_add_irq_chip() must
be set to "-1". What else could it be set to??

I am beginning to suspect that I have misunderstood something. The
regmap-irq API seemed taylor-made for our PMIC with one real h/w
interrupt line with several PMIC chip irq sources controlled by a set
of registers that seemed to slot into the "regmap_add_irq_chip" struct
perfectly. Why should that set of virtual irqs be given a specific base??

I really hope that you can help me clear this issue up, as there are not
many examples of drivers that use the regmap-irq API in linux-release
GIT repository.
