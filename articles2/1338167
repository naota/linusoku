The method used by the gpio-mxs.c driver (of_alias_get_id)
would also work.  The question is which method is preferable.

Ideally I would like to use DT attributes to identify my GPIOs
in the same way as they appear in the schematics.  E.g.
one device may have GPIOs called PORT_A.0 to PORT_A.7,
another one may be EXT.0 to EXT.15.  But a single integer ID
is good enough since GPIO usage is platform specific anyway.
However, the mapping must be static and not depend e.g. on
module load order like now if you use pl061 and some i2c GPIO.
Software must be able to rely on that e.g. GPIO ID 11
always refers to EXT.3.

I don't know much about OpenWrt, but I've seen they have
something:
https://dev.openwrt.org/browser/trunk/target/linux/generic/files/drivers/char/gpio_dev.c
https://dev.openwrt.org/browser/trunk/target/linux/generic/files/include/linux/gpio_dev.h
https://dev.openwrt.org/browser/trunk/package/gpioctl/src/main.c
