OK, now I can see the problem here, too.  The key is that it happens
only on Linux console, not on X.  That's why no one else reported.
I guess the problem can be seen on many laptops with LVDS on PCH.

Looking at intel_reg_dumper output, BLC_PWM_CPU_CTL is 0 while other
registers are set correctly.  This seems coming from the rewrite of 
backlight control code by commit
  24ded204: drm/i915: properly enable the blc controller on the right pipe
and
  a4f32fc3: drm/i915: don't forget the PCH backlight registers
    
While the latter fixes the regression by the former commit, it still
doesn't cover this regression.

I don't know the exact hardware behavior, but it looks like that
resetting BLC_PWM_PCH_CTL2 and BLC_PWM_PCH_CTL1 clears the
BLC_PWM_CPU_CTL (oh what confusing reg names).

FWIW, the commit 520c41cf you mentioned is no direct cause.  This
patch works fine on the top of 3.5 kernel.  But it's like a bad drug,
the combination of this and other two commits break things.

The patch below is my quick fix.  It worked on an HP laptop.
Hugh, could you give it a try?


thanks,

Takashi

Subject: [PATCH] drm/i915: Fix blank panel at reopening lid on Linux console

When you reopen the lid on Linux console on a laptop with PCH, the
panel suddenly goes blank.  It seems because BLC_PWM_CPU_CTL register
is cleared when BLC_PWM_PCH_CTL1 and BLC_PWM_PCH_CTL2 registers are
played.

This patch fixes the problem by setting BLC_PWM_CPU_CTL after enabling
BLC_PWM_PCH_CTL_1 and _2 registers.
