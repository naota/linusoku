I guess you mean unmap_ref_private and that has been changed by you
(0c176d5 mm: hugetlb: fix pgoff computation when unmapping page from
vma)...  I was wrong at that time when giving my Reviewed-by. The patch
didn't break anything because you still find all relevant vmas because
vma_hugecache_offset just provides a smaller index which is still within
boundaries.
I think that 0c176d52 should be reverted because we do not have to refer
to the head page in this case and as we can see it causes confusion.
