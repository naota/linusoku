It is happy to map !write host memory space to the readonly memslot,
and they can coexist as well.

readonly memslot checks the write-permission by seeing slot->flags and
!write memory checks the write-permission in hva_to_pfn() function
which checks vma->flags. It is no conflict.

The issue was trigged by this code:

                } else {
                        if (async && (vma->vm_flags & VM_WRITE))
                                *async = true;
                        pfn = KVM_PFN_ERR_FAULT;
                }

If the host memory region is readonly (!vma->vm_flags & VM_WRITE) and
its physical page is swapped out (or the file data does not be read in),
get_user_page_nowait will fail, above code reject to set async,
then we will get a fault pfn and async=false.

I guess this issue also exists in "QEMU write protected mapping" as
you mentioned above.
