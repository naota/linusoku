The question of whether or not a program or driver which dynamically
links with GPL'ed code becomes a derivitive work of the GPL'ed code is
a complex one.  This is especially true if you use GPL'ed header files
that include inline functions or complex CPP macros.  Whether or not
this is actually the case may very well depend on your local legal
jourisdiction, and it's ultimately something where no one on this list
can give you legal advice.

If the drivers are distributed under the GPL, then it's obviously
safe.  If they distributed under some other license, you will need to
consult with your lawyers.

Well, that's obviously something that we would all prefer, since
avoiding needing to talk to lawyers is always a Good Thing (tm).
<grin>

One of the more important reasons is that this removes one of the key
barriers towards getting the driver included in the kernel sources,
which can be a huge advantage from a code maintenance point of view,
and given that more embedded Linux device manufacturers are more
conscious of their obligations under the GPL, it can be an advantage
during the RFP/hardware selection process.
