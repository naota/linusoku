I've looked through the remaining MFD drivers and found one more,
max8925-core, which is using IORESOURCE_IO for something that is
not ISA/PCI IO-space.

BenH actually suggested _OTHER. I think either one is fine.

This gets into a lot more tricky territory: We have a bunch of drivers
doing their own bitmask operations on these, like drivers/video/offb.c
testing

        if ((flags & (IORESOURCE_IO | IORESOURCE_MEM)) == 0)
                return NULL;

or drivers/scsi/gdth.c doing

            if (!(base0 & IORESOURCE_MEM) ||
                !(base2 & IORESOURCE_MEM) ||
                !(base1 & IORESOURCE_IO)) 
                return -ENODEV;

Now I've looked at the three drivers with the immediate problem of
IORESOURCE_IO abuse (max8925, wm831x, 88pm860x) and none of them are
doing such bitmask operations, so I'm reasonably sure we are fine
for those drivers. I also agree that renumbering the resources in a
way that makes it impossible to use bitmasks is a good idea, but
that would actually be pretty invasive because then we have to rewrite
all the functions that currently do it.
