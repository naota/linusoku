=46aulty? Without technical detail I'd be careful with this, as there's
too many broken EFI implementation around.

The only change that has a (very low) potential for causing
problems by itself is the earlier calling of efi_enter_virtual_mode(),
which was requested/recommended by Matthew.

I am e.g. (meanwhile) aware of (Intel) systems that use floating
point instructions in the UEFI runtime code, which is clearly a
violation of the spec; having the kernel continue to be not spec
compliant is a questionable tradeoff.

In any case, without having seen _how_ things break I don't
think a decision should be taken if/how to address this
(apparent) regression.
