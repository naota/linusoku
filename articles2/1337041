Printk is a store-and-forward-model, and it always was. There is no
guarantee at all, that the data is immediately flushed to the console
by the same CPU, it just happens to be in most cases. It's pretty
common though, that a different task is doing that work when it gets
the console lock, and that is not a matter of preemption, it's normal
and expected operation. The data which CPU has emitted the text is
just not available. It would need to be stored in the records, for
this to work.

Your patch just prints the CPU that writes to the console, not
necessarily the one that has stored the data. I think the second one
is which is what you are looking for, but that is not what the patch
does.

Also dmesg and syslog uses the same logic and would put-out all
entirely wrong CPU information with it, because the original
information is long gone.
