If you care if you got a linear or a legacy domain then that shows
you're reyling on having a legacy domain (indeed, my statement above
should've been stronger - if anything in the driver itself cares if it's
got a linear or a legacy domain the driver is buggy).

If the driver doesn't have any inputs which could be used as an
interrupt by another device then it should be set to -1, yes, and
nothing in the code should ever care how the specific virq values are
related to each other.

If the driver does support another device using it as an interrupt
controller then unfortunately for non-DT systems platform data would
need to configure an irq_base so that the interrupt can be supplied to
whatever the other device is but in all other circumstances it should be
set to -1.

It shouldn't, this is what I'm saying.  The IRQs shouldn't have a base
at all and should instead be using a linear domain (which doesn't have
a base but instead maps each IRQ on demand).  What your patch does is to
stop that happening and instead always allocate a legacy domain even
when linear is OK.

It sounds like your code to allocate the IRQs is fine but the code using
the IRQs is buggy as it's relying on the linear domain.
