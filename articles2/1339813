Hello Javier,

We needed a new modular driver mechanism so that we can handle the very
flexible new generation of Cypress multi-touch devices (TMA4XX and TMA5XX).

With this initial set of patches we are providing the primary function
of multi-touch processing, according to protocol B, as the foundation
for future enhancements and future generations of our parts.

We plan to submit patches in the near future for additional modules such
as handling of integrated button codes and firmware class loader
capability.

The Gen3 memory map is very different from the Gen4 and Gen5 products,
however it is not difficult to upgrade the current Gen3 code into a new
set of modules that can fit into this model.

Adding a module patchset for Gen3 also will allow us to add Gen2 support
in that module as well.

Thanks and Best Regards,
ferruh
