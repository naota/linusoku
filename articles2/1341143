I will try to collect the log when I have the laptops handy.

Frankly, IMHO, I think the patch is not about to trust or not to trust
the BIOS. I think this patch just does what the registers are designed
to do.
What if there is a good BIOS claiming some ports not to be switchable
but kernel does so. Isn't it a bad kernel too? :-)
