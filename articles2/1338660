Yes. It's another story.
At the moment, VM doesn't consider such priority-inversion problem
excpet giving the more memory to privileged processes. It's so simple
but works well till now.

"volatile" term is used by John for only his special patch so
I like Ereclaim(Easy Reclaim) rather than volatile.

Right. That's why this patch provides purgepage in address_space_operations.
I think zcache could attach own address_space_operations to the page
which is allocated by zbud for instance, zcache_purgepage which is called by VM
when the page is reclaimed. So zcache don't need custom LRU policy(but still need
linked list for managing zbuddy) and pass the decision to the VM.
