But similarly, people who compile their own kernels are also supposed to
be able to retrieve up-to-date drivers from another tree. I know many
people who use the intel NIC drivers from sf.net and (less) other ones
using myricom's drivers for instance.

I don't really see the value of keeping in the tree drivers that don't
work out of the box, if it's only causing issues and bug reports.

Regards,
Willy
