Oh dear.  Well, no reason to propagate the breakage - if nothing else it
might well explode if we start doing more aggressive power saving with
the regulators (like having an option for dropping down to the lower end
of the voltage ranges in late init which I keep contemplating, it'd
explode with the boards doing this).

It's not a problem to have fixed voltages, the problem is the
combination of specifying voltage ranges in conjunction with not having
anything there that wants to change the voltage.  Especially with things
like the audio supply, it's clear what that's for and it'd normally get
upset with the voltage changing.
