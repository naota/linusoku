Potentially yes, I did say it still races in the changelog.

Yes. Now that it has wrapped it updates the compact_cached_free_pfn
every loop of isolate_freepages here.

                if (isolated) {
                        high_pfn = max(high_pfn, pfn);

                        /*
                         * If the free scanner has wrapped, update
                         * compact_cached_free_pfn to point to the highest
                         * pageblock with free pages. This reduces excessive
                         * scanning of full pageblocks near the end of the
                         * zone
                         */
                        if (cc->order > 0 && cc->wrapped)
                                zone->compact_cached_free_pfn = high_pfn;
                }

Yes, they race at this point. One of two things happen here and I agree
that this is racy

1. Process A does another iteration of its loop and sets it back
2. Process A does not do another iteration of the loop, the cached_pfn
   is further along that it should. The next compacting process will
   wrap early and reset cached_pfn again but continue to scan the zone.

Either option is relatively harmless because in both cases the zone gets
scanned. In patch 4 it was possible that large portions of the zone were
frequently missed.

It recovers quickly and is nowhere near as severe as what patch 4
suffers from.
