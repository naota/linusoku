As I said elsewhere 88pm* needs this as a stable bugfix and wm831x
should be converted over too.

I'm not sure we need one, _REG seems perfectly fine here unless we want
to go with Arnd's suggestion of _OTHER.  Do you have any concerns with
the use of reg?

As I mentioned in my mail a few moments ago I had not replied to your
mails asking these question about which drivers are affected because
those mails have been arriving so quickly since the first one I saw with
the question in that there has not been a chance to do so.

As I've said before I'm fine with the driver changes.  I do feel that it
would be better to also renumber all the existing resource types while
we're at it in order to make it clear that these are just plain numbers,
that's the reason nobody wrote this patch previously.  This will avoid
any future confusion.
