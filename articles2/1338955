Please read the text you quoted above.

The changes you're suggesting are extremely invasive for stable
especially given that we have a simple, driver local, fix available
which is already deployed and used in other drivers in the same kernels
(at least in v3.5 anyway, the change introducing the issue got pushed
into v3.4 unexpectedly so the fix didn't make it).  It would be worrying
if such changes were being accepted into stable.

I agree that the changes you're suggeting seem sensible for v3.7 if
someone wants to work on them, possibly even v3.6 if people are willing
to do something like that after the merge window, but we've got an issue
in stable here which is the most urgent thing.
