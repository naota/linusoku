Ok. Thanks, I'll change it so we move to the inactive list then.

Although while I know the design may still need significant change, I'd 
still appreciate nitpicks, as they might help me better understand the 
mm code and any mistakes I'm making.

Yea, I didn't want to call it ERECLAIMABLE since for this iteration I 
was limiting the scope just to volatile pages. I'm totally fine renaming 
it as the scope widens.
