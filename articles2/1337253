I agree that the wildcard stuff is horrible but that's not something
introduced by this patch. In fact, I'm removing those where there is an
asm-generic header that can be used instead.

In which case, we should probably fix the rules for kvm.h and a.out.h as
well. Neither of these headers have asm-generic versions and I doubt this
is possible, so the header-y lines should be done for each architecture
exporting such a header, no?

If there isn't a generic version of the header, then yes, I guess you have
to modify the architectures that want to export it.

I'm happy to post an extra patch sorting out kvm.h and a.out.h if that's
what's required to get headers building again.
