There were no comments, so I think I can go a bit further and add runtime PM
support to those drivers too. :-)

This requires some core changes, but they aren't too invasive in my opinion.

Patches [1-6/15] are more-or-less the same as before modulo some fixes for bugs
found during more thorough testing.  The remaining patches make the following
changes:

[7/15] - Clean up device PM initialization.
[8/15] - Allow early platform device drivers to use runtime PM helper functions.
[9/15] - Rename the "always_on" device flag to "syscore".
[10/15] - Move the "syscore" flag to the core (from PM domains framework).
[11/15] - Rework the "starting" of devices flagged as "irq safe" in PM domains.
[12/15] - Add runtime PM support to the SH TMU driver.
[13/15] - Add runtime PM support to the SH CMT driver.
[14/15] - Add runtime PM support to the SH MTU2 driver.
[15/15] - Stop using the "syscore" device flag for runtime PM.

Thanks,
Rafael
