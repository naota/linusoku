So this would change the N_NORMAL_MEMORY definition so that N_NORMAL
means !LRU allocs possible? So far N_NORMAL_MEMORY has a wider scope of
meaning. We need an accurate definition of the meaning of all these
attributes.

THe meaning of ZONE_NORMAL seems to change which causes confusion. Please
describe in detail what each of these attributes mean.
