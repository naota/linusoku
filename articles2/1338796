I have tested with a 3.6.0-rc1 guest again, running command:

./trinity --quiet -l off -cadjtimex --dangerous

for normal user:
	only oom info
for root:
	the guest hung without any stall info printed

I'm not sure how this trinity tool implemented, but at least it do help
to produce some rarely kernel bug...

And could you please also provide the way you start the guest? Is there
any special option?
