Note:  I'm no longer maintaining Documentation/, so I'm cc-ing Rob.

I would add a comma:                   tag,

but for a patch that attempts to clarify, I don't find it very helpful.

I don't think it's a good idea to require a historical git archive for
(private) patches.  If I send a patch privately and it contains an SOB:
line, then the maintainer should be able to apply the patch and
use the SOB: from the patch (IMO).  Are you addressing some concern
about fraudulent emails/patches?
