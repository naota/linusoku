Last time I looked at Jan's patches, I though she took care of the 
address re-use issue.  It isn't technically necessary to include 
namespace into the hash mix, but I think it will make chains shorter 
when namespaces are involved.  Might be interesting to look.

Yes, I saw that.

Technically association id must be unique within a namespace.  Having 
global id space may be simpler and correct enough as there would be no 
duplication of ids between namespaces.  The only thing of value the 
per/namespace id space provides is that it restored the theoretical 
maximum on sctp associations one can have.

However, this means teaching IDR about namespaces... :)

We can skip it for now.
