It just seems to me that Valve is pressing ahead with games for Linux 
and no doubt there will be another influx of games and companies to 
follow not far behind if Valve make it a running success. And good luck 
to them. But on the other hand, it seems that kernel development is not 
quite up to scratch yet when it comes to full support for hardware 
graphics. And bring drivers in to the mix. Albeit, I do understand that 
graphics drivers should be handled and worked on by AMD and NVIDIA etc.

It's hard to describe what I mean. Basically, to the outside world via 
media, it is presented as "Valve is taking gaming to Linux. Wow, Linux 
is now capable of gaming!" That's all fine and everything. But we need 
to ensure that the kernel and all other aspects of code under our 
control is up to the task of handling a massive dump of games for Linux. 
Otherwise, it's going to backfire on us and Linux overall. It's moving 
very quickly.
