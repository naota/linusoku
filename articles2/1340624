This is noise from driver. The vmbch entries are optional as per 
document and so should not throw warning. Either fix will go to driver 
or with documentation file and then on DT. Will work on  this as 
independent patch, atleast not with this series.

The sdhci node take the gpio as power-gpio and conflict with this 
regulator gpio. I dropped the vdd_sdmmc1 as sdhci driver need to change 
accordingly to handle deferred probe.
Will add registration of that file later.

The issue is comment was not closed. Fixed it in next patch.

I fixed as per above details and did not observe any failure on my testing.
