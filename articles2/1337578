I agree entirely; that's why I didn't change the default to always use
--no-rolestats, but rather to continue using --rolestats when
interactive and --no-rolestats when scripted.

I found commit 7e1863af1636b304a5f59aab6fb78d38e4079875, but that commit
does not serve the intended purpose.  Defaulting to --rolestats doesn't
make it "harder" to use get_maintainer.pl with git send-email, it just
makes it broken when used.  Meanwhile, the few discussions I see about
get_maintainer.pl just mention the problems caused by using --git, and
get_maintainer.pl has already improved to address those problems by not
using git commit signers for patches to files with active maintainers.

I don't see any value in making it intentionally harder to invoke
correctly while making it easier to invoke incorrectly.  Why not make it
actually work?
