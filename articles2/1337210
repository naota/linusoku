Just saying, that's just the length of the printed line to the console
or syslog, there is no reservation or space used for that internally.

That would be needed, I guess. We easily have server systems with more
than 255 CPUs. It will only be a matter of time, that the number of
CPUs will increase for everybody, I guess.

As said, I really can't tell how generally useful it is, and if people
think that it should be there unconditionally, should not be there at
all, or as a compile time option. Others might have an opinion on
that.

I personally never missed the CPU-ID in the logs. I personally would
find the PID/task ID more interesting, and even that I never really
missed. :)
