This is what providing a separate parent to ensure they're in a
different tree is there to fix.

No, that's not it.  What's happened is that Haojian has posted some
patching changing all the _IO resources to _MEM in the Marvell PMIC
drivers, I think because you yelled at him for using _IO when he
reported that the changes in ioport_resource broke things a few releases
ago.  Obviously this doesn't achieve a huge amount, it's a misplaced
cleanup.

This seems sensible, and I'm sure if that change were made people would
be delighed to use new resource types, but like I say nobody who's
motivated to do anything here seems to have the time to do anything
about it.

Whoever looks at this would need to do some detective work, it does seem
like there must have been a reason to use a bitmask here...
