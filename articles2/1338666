I think it is very important that both stories must be
solved together.  See below...

If others agree, that's fine.  However, the "E" prefix is
currently used differently in common English (for example,
for e-books).  Maybe "ezreclaim"?

The simple VM decisions are going to need a lot more intelligence
(and data?) to drive which page to reclaim.  For example, is it better
to reclaim a pageframe that contains two compressed pages of ephemeral data
or a pageframe that has one active (or inactive) file page?  Such
a policy is not "Easy". ;-)

(Also, BTW, zcache pages aren't in any address space so don't have
an address_space_operations... because it is not possible to directly
address the data in a compressed page.)
