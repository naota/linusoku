This seems a bit excessive and complicated - I'd be inclined to either
just say that the caller is responsible for avoiding confusion here
(obviously if you're changing the direction there's a race anyway) or
store the data in a variable locally rather than having to do I/O on the
device under lock every time it's interacted with.
