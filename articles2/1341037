I know you and your customers focus a lot on tracing. But if there is a
decent improvement with the 'off' case, then I think that's rational
enough for such a change. Remember, tracing is always a second class
citizen to kernel performance.

But I agree that this change is probably not worth it if it's just a
slight performance.

This is why I posted the patch now. I don't have any real good
measurements for performance testing. It showed some improvement with
hackbench, but hackbench is very unreliable for such tests. I'm hoping
others will run it under their work loads to see how things improve.

I think modifying gcc is something that can help more than tracing. But
that's been a pipe dream for such a long time that I've started dreaming
about winning a gold medal in the Olympics instead. Standing on the
podium listening to the crowd chanting your name along with your country
is more fun to dream about than seeing your unlikely code stop becoming
hurdles for the CPU sprinters.

Yes, I had a bit of Olympic overdose lately.
