False alarm. Well, the massive number of EDID probes is consistent, but
that was present in earlier kernels too. The minute-long X start process
was what was unusual, and intermittent: even in 3.5, it starts in a
relatively 'normal' eight seconds normally. I suspect system load, or
i2c bus timeouts or something (it is a really crap bus, after all).
Anyway, it hasn't recurred, which makes it hard to track down further,
let alone bisect :(

I think we have to let this one rest. Dammit. I hate to let a bug slip
away.
