This sounds about right:
root@testvm:~# dmesg | grep SELinux
[    0.004578] SELinux:  Initializing.
[    0.005704] SELinux:  Starting in permissive mode
[    2.235034] SELinux:  Registering netfilter hooks

This looks right as well:

# zcat config.gz | grep SELINUX
CONFIG_SECURITY_SELINUX=y
CONFIG_SECURITY_SELINUX_BOOTPARAM=y
CONFIG_SECURITY_SELINUX_BOOTPARAM_VALUE=1
CONFIG_SECURITY_SELINUX_DISABLE=y
CONFIG_SECURITY_SELINUX_DEVELOP=y
CONFIG_SECURITY_SELINUX_AVC_STATS=y
CONFIG_SECURITY_SELINUX_CHECKREQPROT_VALUE=1
# CONFIG_SECURITY_SELINUX_POLICYDB_VERSION_MAX is not set
CONFIG_DEFAULT_SECURITY_SELINUX=y


Since the problem isn't completely obvious, I'm starting a bisection to 
narrow this down some more.

thanks
