I implemented this for intel and debugged it with intel <-> nouveau
interaction. Unfortunately the nouveau patches aren't ready at this point,
but the git repo I'm using is available at:

http://cgit.freedesktop.org/~mlankhorst/linux/

It has the patch series and a sample implementation for intel, based on
drm-intel-next tree.

I tried to keep it deadlock and race condition free as much as possible,
but locking gets complicated enough that if I'm unlucky something might
have slipped through regardless.

Especially the locking in i915_gem_reset_requests, is screwed up.
This shows what a real PITA it is to abort callbacks prematurely while
keeping everything stable. As such, aborting requests should only be done
in exceptional circumstances, in this case hardware died and things are
already locked up anyhow..
