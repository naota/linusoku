The Macs mux the i2c and display separately. However they don't support
the vendor ACPI interfaces for the mux. The driver that provides the
vga_switcheroo handler is separate from the graphics drivers, and the
same whether the discrete graphics are Radeon or nVidia.

Really to support this in any generic sort of way vga_switcheroo needs
to support muxing the DDC separately from the display, but as Matthew
pointed out the ordering of initialization could be a problem. Even if
we protect the DDC with a mutex how can we guarantee that the switcheroo
handler is registered to switch the DDC before i915 is ready to check
for an EDID?
