Sorry about the slow response.  After thinking it through I decided
that a) adding ad-hoc DT bindings isn't good, and b) doing
it properly is above my head atm (I have too many other tasks to
take care of).  So I decided to use platform data to get stable
GPIO numbers and names for now.

Actually I think the kernel internal GPIO numbers shouldn't be in the
sysfs API, instead userspace should use the names.  Probably it's
best to not use /sys/class/gpio/export but instead let the board
init code export the GPIOs available to userspace with proper names.
Not sure yet...


Thanks,
Johannes
