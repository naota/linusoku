Ah, yes - that's also used on Marvell platforms which presumably aren't
getting much mainline testing either.

Sorry Ben.

Hopefully nobody will add this to the core code either.  I wonder if
it's possible to change the definition of the constants for the resource
types so that they generate a warning if anyone does bitops on them...
that'd also get all the drivers fixed up eventually.

Yeah, that's why the new resource type has never been added - I don't
think anyone had considered the possibility of adding a new type without
also doing the renumbering, I know I didn't when I looked.
