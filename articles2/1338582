MXS != i.MX.

Oh, ick.  What is the problem that means people want to use the FIQ on
these processors?  There's been i.MX2x audio DMA since forever, it had
DMA in mainline before any of the later i.MXs due to them having SDMA.
The original mainline i.MX audio support was done on i.MX27 and didn't
have any issue here, this is the fist I've heard of a problem.

Is that not bitrot due to it being there before SDMA support was?
