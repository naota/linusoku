Why?

[...snip scripts...]

You've submitted enough patches that you've automated as much of the
process as you can; I don't think that makes the defaults less
error-prone.  Given that you've had to explicitly add --no-rolestats to
your scripts, that seems like evidence in *favor* of making this change.

As it stands now, the current default of --rolestats makes the obvious
command line of
git send-email --to-cmd='scripts/get_maintainer.pl' *.patch
send broken emails that go to some maintainers but not all.  I think it
makes sense to change the default so that the obvious usage becomes the
correct one.
