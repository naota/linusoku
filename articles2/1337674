Please pay MORE attention to the changelog - obviously there's no
problem mapping automatically allocated IRQs, there's only any effect if
they happen to GET allocated at zero.

The only real issue I see with the current code is that if the user
explicitly wants to statically allocate an IRQ range at zero they can't.
The current intended behaviour is that we use a linear domain unless a
positive IRQ base is specified, though we're not quite doing that right
now as a transitional measure until drivers are updated.

The current da9052 driver usage seems to have quite a few problems, I do
recall having to fix some problems that make me doubt if it ever worked
well.  Looking at the code now I see it's using hard coded references to
absolute IRQ numbers which is an issue...  It should be being converted
to use regmap_irq_get_virq().
