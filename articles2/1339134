If you are using checkpatch as a guide, run
"./scripts/checkpatch.pl -f --strict net/appletalk/ddp.c"
after you patch it and also correct any problems found in
the area you want to update too.

A second option is to use emacs with the proper linux
style indentation.

(See: Documentation/CodingStyle, Chapter 9: You've made a mess of it)

Another option is not to patch the file at all.

Also, don't submit multiple patches, resubmit 1 single patch
with all the appropriate corrections.
