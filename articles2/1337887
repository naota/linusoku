No, that's not the point. What we get via the i2c runtime data is an
interrupt number. The driver is driven by that interrupt and doesn't
poll on a GPIO line, which is how it should be.

However, in order to know when to stop reading from the device, we need
to monitor the GPIO line after the interrupt has arrived, and read as
long as the line is asserted. Then we stop reading and wait for the next
interrupt to arrive.

Hence, what we need here is either a GPIO/IRQ controller that is able to
handle level-IRQs (which the PXA can't do), or we need to have a generic
way to map IRQ lines back to GPIOs.

Of course, I could pass the GPIO in the platform data and the IRQ in the
I2C data and leave it to the user of the driver to keep both values in
sync, but I wanted to avoid that.
