Please pay MORE attention to the changelog - obviously there's no problem mapping automatically allocated IRQs, there's only any effect if they happen to GET allocated at zero.

That is the problem - they are allocated at zero, and hence my patch

The only real issue I see with the current code is that if the user explicitly wants to statically allocate an IRQ range at zero they can't.

I don't want to explicitly allocate at zero.

The current intended behaviour is that we use a linear domain unless a positive IRQ base is specified, though we're not quite doing that right now as a transitional measure until drivers are updated.

The fact remains that my patch enables the DA9058 driver to work in v3.5

The current da9052 driver usage seems to have quite a few problems, I do recall having to fix some problems that make me doubt if it ever worked well.  Looking at the code now I see it's using hard coded references to absolute IRQ numbers which is an issue...  It should be being converted to use regmap_irq_get_virq().
