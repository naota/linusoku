The reason they're set like that is legacy - that's how they're set up
in a kernel
(pre-DT) that we know works. Most of those ranges are directly from the Babbage
reference and stay like that in the Babbage DT too - so there's another broken
one nobody noticed. I know what those voltages should be, but we're
leaving that for another patch that restricts the range of voltages
(it works right
now, since there are no consumers, nothing CHANGES the voltages as
configured at U-Boot time, and anything not boot-on is just not listed
in the DT anyway, but some of them really need to stay on)

There are few consumers because the primary ones out there are the display
controllers and USB hubs and some other things. MMC should be a consumer
but since on one board we share two MMC slots with one regulator we don't
want anyone to change the voltage (it breaks spec anyway, since we can't
provide more than 3.15V with FSL's PMIC and it should be 3.3V by default)
and since you can't coordinate between MMC hosts on what the lowest voltage
both cards can support actually is.. having someone change it would be
bad.
