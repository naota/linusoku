There are AMD systems with similar problems. For example I had a system
with 2 IO-APICs but only one was described in the IOMMU ACPI table.

These operating systems probably don't support interrupt remapping, or
the IOMMU at all.

This is exactly how I fixed this issue on the AMD side too. Mind to
submit the patch?
