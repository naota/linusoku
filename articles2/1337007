As the special value "disabled" is available as of these patches, one could
consider this an extension.  I agree.

Personally, I too think that the PNP ABI in sysfs has its rough edges.  However, 
as with the deprecation of any existing ABI, this would require a new ABI first, 
then some time where the old and new ABI live in co-existence, and then to remove 
the currently available ABI.

The current ABI does not allow for the kernel to run on my hardware: this is 
a/the problem.  The proposed extension fixes the problem.  

While I agree with your first statement, for the time being I do not see a 
better solution other than to extend the ABI. 

At this point I am repeating my "call for comments" to the community. :-)
