Changelog since V2
o Capture !MIGRATE_MOVABLE pages where possible
o Document the treatment of MIGRATE_MOVABLE pages while capturing
o Expand changelogs

Changelog since V1
o Dropped kswapd related patch, basically a no-op and regresses if fixed (minchan)
o Expanded changelogs a little

Allocation success rates have been far lower since 3.4 due to commit
[fe2c2a10: vmscan: reclaim at order 0 when compaction is enabled]. This
commit was introduced for good reasons and it was known in advance that
the success rates would suffer but it was justified on the grounds that
the high allocation success rates were achieved by aggressive reclaim.
Success rates are expected to suffer even more in 3.6 due to commit
[7db8889a: mm: have order > 0 compaction start off where it left] which
testing has shown to severely reduce allocation success rates under load -
to 0% in one case.  There is a proposed change to that patch in this series
and it would be ideal if Jim Schutt could retest the workload that led to
commit [7db8889a: mm: have order > 0 compaction start off where it left].

This series aims to improve the allocation success rates without regressing
the benefits of commit fe2c2a10. The series is based on 3.5 and includes
the commit 7db8889a to illustrate what impact it has to success rates.

Patch 1 updates a stale comment seeing as I was in the general area.

Patch 2 updates reclaim/compaction to reclaim pages scaled on the number
	of recent failures.

Patch 3 captures suitable high-order pages freed by compaction to reduce
	races with parallel allocation requests.

Patch 4 is an upstream commit that has compaction restart free page scanning
	from an old position instead of always starting from the end of the
	zone

Patch 5 adjusts patch 5 to restores allocation success rates.

I know that the allocation success rates in 3.3.6 was 78% in comparison
to 36% in 3.5. With the full series applied, the success rates are up to
around 60% with some variability in the results. This is not as high
a success rate but it does not reclaim excessively which is a key point.

Previous tests on V1 of this series showed that patch 4 on its own adversely
affected high-order allocation success rates.

Note that swap in/out rates remain at 0. In 3.3.6 with 78% success rates
there were 71881 pages swapped out.

The direct reclaim and kswapd velocities change very little. kswapd velocity
is around the 1000 pages/sec mark where as in kernel 3.3.6 with the high
allocation success rates it was 8140 pages/second.
