Could you please also try to reduce the CONFIG_RCU_CPU_STALL_TIMEOUT
from 60 to 3 and see whether the rcu stall info will show again?(sorry I
can't do it by my self since the stall info never appear in my sight...)

That will be very helpful as I suppose it is time to recover
CONFIG_RCU_CPU_STALL_TIMEOUT to a reasonable value now ;-)
