I do appreciate the suggestion, and considered this earlier when you 
posted this before.

Unfotunately the transparent merging/splitting/etc is actually not 
useful for me, since I manage other data per-range. The earlier generic 
rangetree/intervaltree implementations I tried limiting the interface to 
basically add(), remove(), search(), and search_next(), since when we 
coalesce intervals, we need to free the data in the structure 
referencing the interval being deleted (and similarly create new 
structures to reference new intervals created when we remove an 
interval). So the coalescing/splitting logic can't be pushed into the 
interval management code cleanly.

So while I might be able to make use of your kinterval in a fairly 
simple manner (only using add/del/lookup), I'm not sure it wins anything 
over just using an rbtree.  Especially since I'd have to do my own 
coalesce/splitting logic anyway, it would actually be more expensive as 
on add() it would still scan to check for overlapping ranges to merge.

I ended up dropping my generic intervaltree implementation because folks 
objected that it was so trivial (basically just wrapping an rbtree) and 
didn't handle some of the more complex intervaltree use cases (ie: 
allowing for overlapping intervals). The priotree seemed to match fairly 
closely the interface I was using, but apparently its on its way out as 
well, so unless anyone further objects, I think I'll just fall back to a 
simple rbtree implementation.

thanks
