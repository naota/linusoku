What is the exact difference that you want to establish?

Well seems that I am having second thoughts about this. While is it true
that current page migration can only move pages on the LRU there are
already various mechanisms proposed and implemented that can move pages
not on the LRU (like page table pages). Not sure if this is still a useful
distinction to make. There is also the issue that segments from
"N_LRU_MEMORY" may be allocated and then become not movable anymore.

For the slab case that you want to solve here you will need to know if the
node has *only* movable memory and will never have any ZONE_NORMAL memory.
If so then memory control structures for allocators that do not allow
movable memory will not need to be allocated for these node. The node can
be excluded from handling.
