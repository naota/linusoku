For SSI in I2S mode, I think it works great, AC97 not so much. It's
the AC97 mode
the FIQ stuff is there to fix. It seems a bunch of boards use AC97
codecs (for no
good reason)

Possibly. I'm going to wait for Sascha to explain it again.. if AC97
was the predicate
for FIQ being required, it doesn't make any sense for a codec that says in it's
description that it's I2S. It may not be bitrot but pure,
unadulterated zeal on the part
of whoever wrote that Kconfig snippet - enable everything, in case it
fails (actually
that kind of thing is why I fear for nuking the building of this
driver since if FIQ stuff
is silently required by something else and all that kept it in there
was some badly
thought out or bitrotted Kconfig entries... I don't want to cause a
world of hurt).
