Do you mean that regulator_get() would parse sub-nodes looking for a 
match? That seems rather dangerous and error-prone, especially if one 
has actual devices within the sub-nodes - their regulators could be 
stolen by the parent device.

I think we only have two choices for this:

1) Stick to the scheme where resources are declared at the device level, 
such as they can be referenced by name in the sub-nodes (basically what 
I did in this patch):

backlight {
      compatible = "pwm-backlight";
      ...
      backlight-supply = <&backlight_reg>;

      power-on-sequence {
          step@0 {
              regulator = "backlight";
              enable;
          };

This would translate by a get_regulator(dev, "backlight") in the code 
which would be properly resolved.

2) Export a lower-level DT API for resolving phandles directly from a 
property, similar to of_get_named_gpio. We would then have 
of_get_named_regulator and of_get_named_pwm.

If 2) is deemed acceptable, then I think we should go for it as it would 
provide the most compact and readable DT syntax. Otherwise 1) is still 
acceptable IMHO, as it should at least make sense to people already 
familiar with how the DT works.

Opinions from DT experts?

Alex.
