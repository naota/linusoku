It's because IO_SPACE_LIMIT is set as 0 if there's no PCI devices. But
IORESOURCE_IO is also used in PMIC mfd drivers to distinguish
different components.

    ARM: io: add a default IO_SPACE_LIMIT definition

    Add a default IO_SPACE_LIMIT definition.  Explain the chosen value and
    suggest why platforms would want to make it larger.

Changing bitmask to a value for IORESOURCE type is a risk. I agree on Mark
that someone will complain on this.

Could we consider to expand the usage of IORESOURCE_IO? Maybe we can
use it for both ISA/PCI and IO related in chip.
