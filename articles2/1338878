Actually I'm not sure whether the driver does not need to do their reset after
bus level reset, but I agree with you, now I'm thinking that using reset_devices
is better rather than adding narrow one which is limited to PCI express, otherwise
we may have to add new parameter every time when adding new reset method, such as
reset_pcie_devices, reset_pci_legacy_devices, etc.
