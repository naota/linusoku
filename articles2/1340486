This is libcryptsetup userspace so better list for this is dmcrypt
mailing list (and/or cc me, I will handle these changes anyway).

The allocated crypto "file" context cannot be later used for some kind
of operations. I do not like this approach musch... 
You cannot use file argument for dm-target directly, so your patch
is useful only for your use case but not for anything else.

Anyway, I am sure there is better way how to solve it I just need
to understand what the problem is. What's wrong if code allocates
loop devices (if argument is file)?
Performance? Loop not available? Need root access?

Please explain what's the problem first.
(btw that patch is mangled by a mailer but not a problem now).

Once kernel get this option (if you convince upstream:) then I will
the option to userspace. We have to handle many dm-crypt extensions
so not a big problem for dm-verity as well.
