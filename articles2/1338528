*sigh*  You must be aware that this isn't getting us anywhere.  As you
know the issues here aren't practical ones if we make sure the resource
trees are split (which is what Haojian should really be doing if he's
not done so already) and that the resource code is sadly difficult to
modify to support new resource types due to the full bitmask that
Haojian mentioned.  

Clearly nobody has the combination of time and interest to add a new
resource type and we do have actual systems running now (and for the
past several years) relying on this.

To be perfectly frank I have a hard time convincing myself that there's
any real problem with the current solution; obviously it's not what _IO
was originally intended for but having several different trees of
resources seems like a reasonable extension here and the effort involved
in any other changes seems disproportionately high.  I guess we could
formalise it by making an alias for _IO but I doubt that'd address the
concerns you have.
