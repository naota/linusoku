The difference is that I'd expect a compiler writer to think that
they've got a free hand in terms of instruction usage that the OS/library
doesn't see - if it's in the instruction manual and it's marked as user
space and non-faulting I'd say it's fair game; once they know that they're
going to take a fault or mark pages specially then they already know they're
going to have to cooperate with the OS, or worry about what other
normal library calls are going to do.
(A bit of googling seems to suggest IA64 and SPARC have played around
with non-faulting load optimisations, but I can't tell how much.)

Not good for someone doing MMIO, but from an evil-compiler point
of view, they might well assume that a pointer is to memory
unless someone has made an effort to tell them otherwise (not that
there is a good standard to do that).
