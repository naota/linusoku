So, the fact that platform devices will get any resource marked
IORESOURCE_IO registered against ioport_resource isn't a problem
then...

Anyway, given that this thread is broken, there's no way for me to find
out what the _original_ issue is that you're talking about.  So I'm going
to guess that it's come up because we're out of IORESOURCE bits.

Let's look a little closer:

#define IORESOURCE_TYPE_BITS    0x00001f00      /* Resource type */
#define IORESOURCE_IO           0x00000100
#define IORESOURCE_MEM          0x00000200
#define IORESOURCE_IRQ          0x00000400
#define IORESOURCE_DMA          0x00000800
#define IORESOURCE_BUS          0x00001000

So, if we made this a numeric index, then we have 32 resource types
to deal with, and no need to bugger around with re-using an existing
type for something else.

This makes sense, MEM, IRQ and DMA are all mutually exclusive, as
should be MEM and IO (because they can't coexist in two resource trees
at the same time.)  BUS only gets used in a hand-full of places and
not with any other flags.

So, looks like we can have 27 new resource types fairly easily.
