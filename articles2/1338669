Looks better. I will use that term from now on.

I should have said more cleary.
VM just pick a page in tail of ezreclaim list and and then just reclaim.
So rotation of the active page or two compresssed pages should be implemented
by smart zcache which can do anyting.

I mean we can make just fake address_space_operations like this.

static struct address_space_operations zcache_aop = {
       .purgepage = zcache_purge_page,
};

static struct address_space zcache_address_space = {
       .a_ops = &zcache_aop,
};

        struct page *page = alloc_page();
        page->mapping = &zcache_address_space;
