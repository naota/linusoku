Does anything show up in dmesg when you turn on
CONFIG_USB_XHCI_HCD_DEBUGGING?  It would be good to know if it is
totally not electrically present, or if there's some sort of xHCI
hardware or software issue that's preventing the webcam from being
enumerated.

Could be.  Can you use any SMBIOS information to change the port
switchover only for those HM70-based laptops?  And is it a particular
laptop vendor or all HM70 laptops?

As Alan said, I would rather not trust the BIOS to provide the correct
port mask.
