Not sure, but it should not cause issues. The PIN is multiplexed between
GPIO6/PWM0/MUTE functionality.
For that matter probably I could just don't care about flags here and
configure the extmute (the internal one) all the time. Not sure, it has bee=

long time I have dealt with the twl4030...

Not with my knowledge. The only board using it is the zoom2 upstream. I know
other boards (not in upstream) which either uses the internal mute or GPIO.

I perfectly understand your point. However how would you imagine this in th=
e core?
We should have something similar to DAPM_SUPPLY which we can attach to the
widget which needs this sort of mute, but how big change we would need in t=
he
core to do this I'm not sure.
I can take a look at this, but I would do it as a follow up series.
