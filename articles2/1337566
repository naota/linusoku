Well you are right I guess. There really is nothing technically wrong 
with the kernel in its current state. And there probably isn't really an 
essential to-do list, so to speak. But I guess I know that we know this 
because we're all developers. However, if new gamers move to Linux and 
find they're experience is not the same as their experience was when 
gaming under Windows, then the eventual blame-game will fall back on us. 
The kernel developers. Even though the responsibility lies with video 
card and hardware developers.

I guess I am just a little concerned that it might not be a smooth and 
happy introduction as Valve is making out. However, if Valve handle this 
correctly and provide the gamer community with enough information and 
documentation, hopefully things will work out. And this might actually 
be the kick in the rear-end that AMD and NVIDIA need to get into gear 
and start developer some useful and Windows equivalent hardware drivers 
for ALL their cards for Linux.
