I can't comment on the sysfs-vs-dev interface location, but I don't
think it addresses Johannes' issue; finding out which GPIO IDs are
provided by which devices.

Perhaps in each device's sysfs node, there should be some information
re: which GPIO range it provides. Right now, perhaps a text file with
the GPIO base it it. With the new /dev interface you mention above,
perhaps a symlink to the /dev file, or a file containing the /dev file's
major/minor number. Or, is there such a thing already (other than
debugfs's gpio file).
