I mean the dir which is added in this patch, "modem_shm" is added to
have a separate list of such modem access drivers.

Its not that tty can be used or cant be used, but just to separate out the
modem related stuff in a separate folder.

SIM(Subscriber Identity Module) used in mobiles.
TEE(security) driver

Maybe tty can do this, but want to have all modem related  separately.
There are many such hardware and many drivers coming up in near future.
