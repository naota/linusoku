The big problem is SATA discard request merge is broken, while doing
MD discard will trigger discard request merge. In this form, I bet Neil will
not accept the patches. So not the problem MD discard patch itself.

Last time Martin said he is working on SCSI discard request merge
patches. That isn't happened yet. Maybe I should ping Jens
to disable discard request merge currently, it's broken for a long
time anyway.
