I am doing a minimal kernel build for my local hardware
configuration.

With the reduction in RAM, 1GB to 512MB, I didn't need to do
test runs with >20 threads to find the peak of the benefit
curve at 16 threads.  Past that, zcache is saturated and I'd
just be burning up my disk.  I'm already swapping out about
500MB (i.e. RAM size) in the 20 thread non-zcache case.

Also, I provide the magnitude numbers (pages, seconds) just
to show my source data.  The %change numbers are the real
results as they remove build size as a factor.

KVM (in-tree) is not a current user of zcache.  While the
use cases of possible future zcache users should be
considered, I don't think they can be used to prevent promotion.

All of the flaws you list do not prevent zcache from being
beneficial right now, as my results demonstrate.  Therefore,
the flaws listed are really potential improvements and can
be done in mainline after promotion.  Even if large changes
are required to make these improvements, they can be made in
mainline in an incremental and public way.
