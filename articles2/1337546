yes.
Assumption being you know _EXACTLY_ what code piece to watch for.
Which may not be the case all times.

You are right that was the next step i did and that shows the problem as well.
The point i was trying to make, with printk showing cpu-id, there are
problems in system that could get highlighted,
given printk almost always runs with linux kernel.

The assumption here is that a developer knows well enough, which code
to modify for logging.
I my experience, that is not true most of the times. A global
defconfig switch is much easier to enable.

Eg: when i have some timing related issue, first thing i go for is to
enable PRINTK_TIME, without even
having to think about the erring code. Then time-stamps lead to bad code.

That is the same though process behind the cpu-id in printk.
