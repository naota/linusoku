Thanks for your answer.
Yes I have netfilter as I need it. However, I tried without it and stil=
l=20
need about 37 seconds to send the 160000 packets I was sending in 11=20
seconds with 2.4.17

I don't think there is any problem with size of the kernel. I still hav=
e=20
plenty of memory available.

All debugging is turned off, and I'm not using SLUB but SLOB.
I have 32Mbytes of RAM. Would SLUB be more performant than SLOB ?
