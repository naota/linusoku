Which part did not make sense so I know which part to elaborate on? Lets
try again randomly with this;

When direct reclaim is running reclaim/compaction for high-order allocations,
it aims to reclaim a minimum number of pages for compaction as controlled
by should_continue_reclaim. Before it entered direct reclaim, kswapd was
woken to reclaim pages at the same order. This patch forces kswapd to use
the same logic as direct reclaim to reclaim a minimum number of pages so
that subsequent allocation requests are less likely to enter direct reclaim.

It was intentional at the time but asking me about it made me reconsider,
thanks. In too many cases, this is a no-op and any apparent increase of
kswapd activity is likely a co-incidence. This is untested but is what I
intended.

mm: kswapd: Continue reclaiming for reclaim/compaction if the minimum number of pages have not been reclaimed

When direct reclaim is running reclaim/compaction for high-order allocations,
it aims to reclaim a minimum number of pages for compaction as controlled
by should_continue_reclaim. Before it entered direct reclaim, kswapd was
woken to reclaim pages at the same order. This patch forces kswapd to use
the same logic as direct reclaim to reclaim a minimum number of pages so
that subsequent allocation requests are less likely to enter direct reclaim.
