That's the case without this patch as it'll still be running
reclaim/compaction just less aggressively. For it to continually try like
the system must be either continually under load preventing compaction ever
working (which may be undesirable for order-3 and the like) or so badly
fragmented it cannot recover (not aware of a situation where this happened).

You could add a separate patch that checked if
defer_shift == COMPACT_MAX_DEFER_SHIFT and to disable reclaim/compaction in
that case but that will require enough SWAP_CLUSTER_MAX pages to be reclaimed
over time or a large process to exit before compaction succeeds again.

I would expect rates under load to be very low with such a patch
applied.
