I aggree that this could be emulated in software by enabling/disabling
the event with a guest/host switch. And, even better, we add this for
every pmu in a generic way. E.g. northbridge counter and I guess also
Intel uncore events do not support G/H counting in hardware. Same to
other pmus that could be imaginable in the future like counters for
IOMMUs or other hardware devices.

But, as some pmus are not related to virtualization or other features
they simply do not need to support those attributes, or we want other
defaults, e.g. enable it system wide. Detecting features with syscall
error checking and then falling back to other defaults does not seem
the right approach to me, because it may require several syscalls to
check *combinations* of supported attributes, makes error logging and
detection more difficult due to noisy log messages and because there
is no strict attribute flag checking in current and older kernels.

I better would like to see a pmu feature flag in the same style as
with /proc/cpuinfo, e.g.:

 $ cat /sys/bus/event_source/devices/cpu/flags
 exclude_host exclude_guest

We also need stricter attribute flag checking, esp. of reseved flags
and for unsupported features in some pmus (I already work on some
patches for this). Userland then checks flags and sets up syscalls
according to the reported flags. The goal should be to avoid syscall
errors at all. Thus, we are able to improve dmesg logging in case of
errors, currently we do not see any message if a syscall fails.

And finally, if a feature could be emulated, we could provide this
emulation of an attr flag to all pmus.

Does this make sense?
