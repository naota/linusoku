As i understood the trace_prink(), one would need to modify existing
printk -> trace_printk. Is my understanding correct?

Most of the times the problem exhibits as a random hang, without having a clue
which code to modify. That time one generic defconfig global switch is
your first tool.

Other issue i found, using this patch, that on multi-core ARM systems,
almost 99% of times, IRQ's are handled by CPU0,
even if CPU0 was really busy and other CPU's were free. I am yet to
understand a good reason why.

this patch also helped in other areas as mentioned in the thread
http://marc.info/?l=linux-omap&m=134401269106619&w=2

Not sure how easy its to use trace_printk for such issues, i found
having one defconfig option was much easier
to get going. Correct me if i have not understood trace_printk well enough.
