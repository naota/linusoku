"raw" means the value as reported to the sensor. For example, for an ADC, the
raw value means the voltage in mV as seen on the sensor's input pins. This
voltage is the voltage to be reported. Converting it to a "real" voltage as,
typically, determined by a set of voltage divider resistors should be done in
user space.

For temperature sensors this is a bit more tricky. Presumably you get readings
from a thermistor or similar. The hwmon subsystem includes a driver for NTC
thermistors; maybe you can get some ideas from it. Maybe you can even use
it and/or extend it to support your hardware.

Question is really what chip you are using, and how exactly your hardware looks
like. Do you use a generic ADC ? If so, is it already supported in the kernel ?
How are the thermistor readings converted and reported to SW ?
