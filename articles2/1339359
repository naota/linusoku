Hi Ferruh,

There is already a driver in the kernel that supports Cypress
TrueTouch(TM) Standard Product (TTSP) controllers Generation3 (Cypress
Txx3xx parts).

The driver has a similar architecture that yours and it has a generic
driver to control the device and a driver for each communication bus
used to communicate with the controller. Drivers for SPI and I2C data
buses are already implemented.

The drivers are:

drivers/input/touchscreen/cyttsp_core.c
drivers/input/touchscreen/cyttsp_i2c.c
drivers/input/touchscreen/cyttsp_spi.c

This driver was original developed by Kevin for Android and used
multi-touch protocol type A. Since the hardware is able to track
contacts by hardware I added protocol type B support and cleaned the
driver to be merged on mainline.

I wonder how big is the delta between cyttsp Gen3 and cyttsp Gen4 and
if both drivers could be merged or at least refactored to reuse some
common code. I don't have the specification for any of the device
families but by looking at your code it seems that this may be
possible.

Thanks a lot and best regards,
Javier
