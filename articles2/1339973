Hi, 

Do you try to make work your pedal with torcs or speed dreams?
Looks like yes... 
I had the same issue with fanatec porche 911 gt2.

I contacted HID driver maintainer, but since for now we don't have a proper
solution (i.e. fixing HID driver), I had to do a dirty thing in the source code.

Replace the fragment you attached in drivers/human/human.cpp with

        switch (cmd[CMD_CLUTCH].type) {
                case GFCTRL_TYPE_JOY_AXIS:
                        clutch = joyInfo->ax[cmd[CMD_CLUTCH].val];

                        // dirty stuff, sorry
                        if (clutch  <= 0) clutch = -clutch;
                        else clutch = 2.0 - clutch;
                        clutch /= 2.0;
                        car->_clutchCmd = fabs(cmd[CMD_CLUTCH].pow *
                                                pow(fabs(clutch),
                                                1.0f / cmd[CMD_CLUTCH].sens));
                        break;

and it should work... without calibration

Regards,
Tigran
