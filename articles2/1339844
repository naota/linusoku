Thanks for this patchset; Could you please also fill up
Documentation/dma-buf-sharing.txt, to include the relevant bits?

We've tried to make sure the Documentation corresponding is kept
up-to-date as the framework has grown, and new features are added to
it - and I think features as important as dma-fence and dmabufmgr do
warrant a healthy update.
