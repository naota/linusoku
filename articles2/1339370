This issue should be caught by the current check in
parse_ioapics_under_ir()

if (ir_supported && ir_ioapic_num != nr_ioapics) {

Some of them use interrupt-remapping only if the bios has pre-enabled
x2apic/interrupt-remapping etc. But Linux tries to enable
x2apic/interrupt-remapping even if bios doesn't.

yes, we should be able to extend the check in parse_ioapics_under_ir()
to check for this condition.
