This applies to any patch, not just large ones and/or drivers.

This sentence is long and confusing. Perhaps something like: "Other
developers may send patches to show what changes should be made, rather
than just making comments".

If another developer sends a patch with a Signed-off-by, regardless of
whether it is a patch against mainline, or a patch on top of a patch,
why would you not be required to keep the Signed-off-by tag? Does this
mean that I can review somebodies else's patch, send them a patch on top
of it with my Signed-off-by, and they can simply drop it and take my
work uncredited?

If a developer wants to provided patches on top of someone else's work,
but does not want to be credited with a Signed-off-by, then surely they
should just not sign-off their patch?

You also misspelled "Signed-of-by" several times.

I don't think this necessarily needs to be stated. Lots of patches,
especially drivers, have probably had several authors, but only require
the sign-off of the person doing the actual submission. So the rules
should be (IMHO):

 1) The person submitting the code must sign the patch off.
 2) If another person contributes to the code, whether during
    development, or as part of a review, then they should have
    a Signed-off-by tag applied only if they provide one.
 3) Signed-off-by tags (all tags really) should never be added
    without the express permission of the person themselves.

If additional credit needs to be given, but the creditor doesn't want to
provide a Signed-off-by then one of the other tags could be used (such
as Reviewed-by), or the person could be mentioned in the changelog
perhaps? e.g:

  "Parts of the foo function provided by Joe Bloggs <joe@bloggs.com>"
