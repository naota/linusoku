Well, stop causing frustration at this end.  Yes, you're the cause of my
frustration, because you're doing everything you possibly can to give
reasons why not without even looking at the facts.  And you continue to
do so at the bottom of this mail.

If you want to be constructive, then actually take a bloody look at my
suggestion, try it out and report back whether it works.  Stop attacking
my proposal in whatever weak ways you can, especially in ways that I've
already dismissed as being totally irrelevant.

As far as I'm concerned, your arguments so far against my proposal are
all completely and utterly petty, and that's putting it mildly.

Sigh.  Here we go a fucking again.  I've already covered this.  But
in case you haven't read, here it is again.

And that combination is illegal today.  But the amount of code which
the value will be exposed to is limited to _just_ the platform code,
which, for the parts affeced, I'm the author of.  And I've read it
before creating the patch to make sure it will work as I expect it
do.

Right, thank you, finally you've said something constructive at last.
But I'm all out of patience with you to create a patch; you've wasted
all my good will away through your petty arguments.

Twice I asked.  The first time was with the IORESOURCE_FOO mail, which
you had time to read, and reply to - and your reply was yet another
"why we can't do it this way" whinge.  Yes, you had time to read it,
you had time to answer it with reasons why not, but not to give any
useful information back.

Maybe you should be the one to take a step back and look at the quality
of your replies in this thread.  Because none of them have been
constructive.

Instead, you'll notice that many of my replies have been outlining
solutions to the problem, and *actually* contain patches to address
the issue.  Yours?  All whinges about why not.

"someone having the time to add the new resource type" ?  Oh for fuck sake
Mark, what the hell are you talking about?  How long does it take to apply
a bloody patch?

So yet again, this is another bloody whinge from you about why not.

So I'm wasting my time on this thread.  Someone else can fix the other
driver in the way I've outlined.  I've shown you how.  I've shown you
that there's agreement from other people for my approach.  There isn't
an issue with -stable with this approach.  There isn't an issue with
-rc.

All it needs is for someone to do the search and replace on the relevant
drivers.
