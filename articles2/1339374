No, there's one IOMMU and one IOAPIC, so this check doesn't catch it.
The problem is that the ids in the ACPI tables for the devices don't
match.

I already sent the patch, but where I added it is in
intel_enable_irq_remapping(), just after the call to
parse_ioapics_under_ir(). But it would be no problem to move it if that
makes more sense.
