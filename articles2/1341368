Not really, but some (rather obvious) ideas on what to try:

- Does 3.5 work? (could be that whatever broke things for you was 
introduced in 3.5.1).

- Does the latest 3.4.8 work?

- Does 3.6-rc1 (or even the latest snapshot of Linus' tree, post-rc1) 
work?

- If noone comes up with a good idea as to the cause of your troubles, you 
could try bisecting between your last working kernel and 3.5.1 to try and 
narrow it down to one (or a few) commits that are causing your trouble.
