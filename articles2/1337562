I think the default use of the get_maintainer script is
actually not scripted but interactive, where the user is
just trying to figure out who the maintainer is.

Anyone using get_maintainer in a scripted way should go
through the effort of figuring out in advance who will
be a recipient.

There were some discussions awhile back in 2010 about the
preferred defaults.

Perhaps you can read those discussions about why the default
is the way it is.
