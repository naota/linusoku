Agreed.
I hope it should be added by changelog.

I can't understand this part.
We don't defer lower order than compact_order_failed by aff62249.
Do you mean lower order compaction context should be a lamb for
deferred higher order allocation request success? I think it's not fair
and even I can't understand rationale why it has to scale the number of pages
reclaimed with the number of recent compaction failture.
Your changelog just says "What we have to do, NOT Why we have to do".
