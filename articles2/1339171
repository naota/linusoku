I've been using userspace built from the buildroot image hosted on
linux-xtensa.org with gcc-4.4.5 + binutils-2.20.1. I use gcc-4.6.3
(without libc) + binutils-2.22 to build the kernel. I had an impression that
mentioned buildroot was able to produce userspace where LTP could
run successfully for days. So, my initial plan is to use that userspace
with mainline kernel.

I have a subset thereof that builds toolchain (without libc) and the kernel.
Buildroot gave me an impression of not very reproducible environment, perhaps
I spent too little time on it. So I made an image and I hope that
pre-built image
may be used, at least in the beginning. I had to lightly patch U-boot hosted on
linux-xtensa.org to make it work on LX60/110/200 QEMU models. I guess we
can start with pre-built image of the bootloader too.

Ok, I'll consolidate my scripts to something that could be used as such
system and share them. I have an editor access to wiki.linux-xtensa.org.

Ok. I'd like to have even generic patches (my current queue is mostly
generic) reviewed. Do you prefer to read them on github or on the
linux-xtensa mailing list?

It's there since qemu-1.0.

Completely agree.
