Yes, not best naming on variables, but I didn't had much ideas either on a
better name, I'll see if I can come with something better. I think I fixed
all possible off-by-one errors, if you spot something else let me know.

Yes, it's incomplete, but does fix one case and is no regression, I
don't see an issue keeping it. I'll wrap up and send the patch fixing
the other issues, Cc'ing to stable as well.
