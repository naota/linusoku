I hit this issue some time ago when I was trying to do a Thumb2 build
of this kernel.

I don't remember having to fix the generic FIQ code just for this,
but I had a patch somewhere to swap r13 with another register in
ssi-fiq.S.  I think that use of r13 in ways not permitted for Thumb
was the only problem I found.  I can try to dig it out if you want.

In any case, it didn't seem worth pushing at the time, because it
seemed that the SSI FIQ code was not relevant to any v7 or later
platform -- so building that code for Thumb presumably doesn't make
sense.

Cheers
