Hi Seth,

Sorry for the belated response. On Oz time here.
I don't have a /var/log/kernel.log !
Let me make sure of something:
This switcher code is to be run on osx, no? That's where gfxcardstatus 
lives and where I can effect the card switch. Just to make sure.
So I'm running osx mountain lion, and the only thing I see in the logs 
when I switch cards (using gfxcardstatus) is what I pasted below. and 
you're right, it was not in message.log, but system.log (it was late). I 
just went through the whole thing again.
Am I missing something?
Cheers,
Francois
