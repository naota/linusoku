Thanks, this helped.  Resume works correctly on Mackerel with 3.6-rc1.

However, I'm now seeing a different problem related to system suspend on that,
board which is that sh7372_enter_a3sm_common() returns immediately, as though
at least one of the wakeup signals was permanently asserted.  This hadn't
happened before your last pull request was merged, so I suspect that one
of the irqdomain patches might introduce this behavior.

Thanks,
Rafael
