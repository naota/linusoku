Hi Seth --

Good discussion.  Even though we disagree, I appreciate
your enthusiasm and your good work on the kernel!

I think that's exactly what I said in a snippet of my response
that you deleted.  A cache needs to work well both when it
is non-full and when it is full.  You are only demonstrating
that it works well when it is non-full.  When it is
"saturated", bad things can happen.  Finding the "peak of the
benefit" is only half the work of benchmarking.

So it appears you are trying to prove your point by showing
the workloads that look good, while _not_ showing the workloads
that look bad, and then claiming you don't care about those
bad workloads anyway.

You'll have to explain what you mean because, if I understand
correctly, this is just not true.  Different build sizes
definitely affect memory management differently, just as
different values of N (for make -jN) have an effect.

That wasn't my point.  Andrea identified the flaw as an issue
of zcache.

Your results only demonstrate that zcache is beneficial on
the workloads that you chose to present.  But using the same
workload with slightly different parameters (-jN or compiling
a larger kernel), zcache can be _detrimental_, and you've chosen
to not measure or present those cases, even though you did
measure and present some of those cases in your first benchmark
runs posted in March (on an earlier kernel).

I can only speak for myself, but this appears disingenuous to me.

Sorry, but FWIW my vote is still a NACK.  IMHO zcache needs major
work before it should be promoted, and I think we should be spending
the time fixing the known flaws rather than arguing about promoting
"demo" code.
