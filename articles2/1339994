Yeah, it'd be nicer to do it but given that the second step is adding a
new, non-bitmask resource type to a set of resource types that have
previously been all bitmasks I know I'd not get taken seriously
suggesting it as a fix to a system integrator without a big argument
about it and general unhappiness, most people doing stable releases I've
worked with would have a similar response.  It's not that it's unsafe,
it's that it sets off alarm bells and requires more due dilligence.
