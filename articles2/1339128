I have looked at your suggestion, and I have repeatedly agreed that your
suggestion is the best suggestion going forwards.  I don't think there
is any way in which I could be clearer on that.

Well, I guess we have to agree to disagree on that.  I'm just very much
more conservative than you about what I'd be willing to put into a
stable release - my instincts on this are very strongly towards avoiding
any possibility of introducing unintended side effects and one way of
doing that is minimising the scope of any change.  Even where things
should be correct and look correct minimising the risk of exposing any
latent bugs (including those in systems derived from the stable release)
is a major consideration for me with any sort of stable fix.  Clearly
any code that's affected is buggy but having people be able to trust
stable releases is a very big factor.

This is all that we're disagreeing on, everyone including me agrees that
your change is clearly the best change going forwards but I'm much more
paranoid about stable releases than you are.

Hrm, if you're referring to <20120807111331.GC24257@flint.arm.linux.org.uk>
I don't actually seem to be able to see the question in your mail.

The main reason I haven't send any patches was that by the time we were
satisfied that this was OK people were already sending code changes so
it seemed like that was in hand (and indeed you have sent a patch for
this).

It's the bit with confirming that we're OK not treating the resource
types as a bitmask that's time consuming; until this thread nobody had
gone through and checked that this would be OK.
