I wouldn't say it's in bad shape, I just built an vmlinux image from the 
latest tree (3.6.0-rc1), but it might not be very stable. One of the 
major issues is not really the kernel but  there's actually no way to 
build a fairly recent version of the toolchain. I have been using a 
somewhat more recent buildroot version than what is on xtensa-linux.org, 
but even that version of buildroot is rather old now and needed a few 
patches.

The tree on linux-xtensa.org has quite diverted from mainline now. Pete 
has done a great job maintaining those kernel versions, fixing a lot of 
bugs, and adding a ton of new additional features, but it will take 
quite some effort to merge them with the latest kernel.

Awesome!! Every help is very much appreciated.

You might expect that I'm more than curious to see those changes :-)

That would be great. Might I also add that we'd need to have a working 
toolchain and bootable image. For me, buildroot seems to be the quickest 
route here. That would also require possibly adding patches to the 
toolchain and uClibc that are currently missing. There's also the 
bootloader, etc.

Yes, Andrew has been very helpful stepping in and adding those patches. 
Most if not all of those patches were fixes because of generic kernel 
changes and not major fixes or changes to the core of the Xtensa port.

Ideally, it would be great if you could create a git tree (I saw you 
already have a version on github already?) that would allow us to look 
over those patches. The goal should be to have a system to build 
toolchain, bootable image, and kernel, so we can run some regression 
tests on either the simulator (qemu) or an actual board. Once we have a 
regression test system in place, we can then add more features and 
funnel those patches either through me or more directly..

What do you think?

If you already have such a system in place, it would be great if you 
could send me some instructions to recreate it locally. We can give you 
also access to the wiki to add any information there.

For now, I would really appreciate if you could hold off sending any 
major patch to the linux-kernel mailing list until we had a chance to 
look over them unless it's some generic patch (fixing an issue because 
of an API change to the kernel, etc.)

Andrew is currently adding all Xtensa patches sent to that list, and I 
would hate having to irritate him having to ask to remove or change 
patches, etc.

That's so great!! I didn't know there was a QEMU port for Xtensa.

Bottom line, I hope you agree with me that the kernel, although the most 
fun part, is only one piece of the puzzle, and we also need a running 
system. If you already have that in place, we can jump to the kernel 
fairly quickly.

Thanks,
