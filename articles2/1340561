Mostly looks ok but I have one question;

You might have answered this already as I skipped over a few revisions
and if you have, sorry about that and please add a comment :)

This trylock_page looks risky as it looks like it can fail if another
process running compaction tries to isolate this page. It locks the page,
finds it cant and releases the lock but in the meantime this trylock can
fail. It triggers a WARN_ON so we'll get a bug report but it leaves the
reference count elevated and this page has now leaked.

Why not just lock_page(page)? As you have already isolated this page you
know that the lock is only going to be held by a parallel compacting
process checking the reference count and the delay will be short. As a
bonus you can drop the WARN_ON check in the caller and make this void as
the WARN_ON check in the caller becomes redundant.
