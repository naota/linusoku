Good plan!

I'm not settled on Buildroot, but I had the best experience with it so 
far. OpenEmbedded was a real pain when I used it (it might have improved 
a lot since, though). I once even started my own build system, but it 
became fairly complicated once I wanted to build a bootable system with 
a C library and various packages.

I looked over them briefly, and only had one or two questions. I'll send 
them tomorrow (our time).
