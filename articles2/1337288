	Hi Linus,

The following changes since commit 28a33cbc24e4256c143dce96c7d93bf423229f92:
  Linus Torvalds (1):
        Linux 3.5

are available in the git repository at:

  ra.kernel.org:/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/geert/linux-m68k.git for-linus
  git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/geert/linux-m68k.git for-linus

Andreas Schwab (1):
      m68k: Make sys_atomic_cmpxchg_32 work on classic m68k

Geert Uytterhoeven (14):
      m68k: Use Kbuild logic to import asm-generic headers
      m68k: Use asm-generic version of <asm/types.h>
      m68knommu: Clean up printing of sections
      m68k: Remove duplicate FPU config option
      m68k: Move CPU_HAS_* config options
      m68k: delay, muldi3 - Use CONFIG_CPU_HAS_NO_MULDIV64
      m68k: Introduce config option CPU_HAS_NO_UNALIGNED
      m68k: CPU32 does not support unaligned accesses
      mtd/uclinux: Use generic __bss_stop instead of _ebss
      m68k: Replace m68k-specific _[se]bss by generic __bss_{start,stop}
      m68k: Use asm-generic version of <asm/sections.h>
      m68k/sun3: Remove unselectable code in prom_init()
      zorro: Remove unused zorro_bus.devices
      m68k/apollo: Rename "timer" to "apollo_timer"

Greg Ungerer (1):
      m68knommu: Allow ColdFire CPUs to use unaligned accesses

Paul Bolle (2):
      m68k: Remove five unused headers
      m68k: Remove never used asm/shm.h

All of these (except for the top commit) have been in linux-next for at
least 2 weeks, and were ready at the 3.5 timeframe, but I didn't want to
send a pull request the night I left for vacation.

The top commit is a recent fix by Andreas (also destined for stable) that
required one more linux-next cycle, so I had to delay my pull request to
today.

The "mtd/uclinux" change is not really an MTD change, but an architecture
change, and has been acked by the relevant architecture maintainers (for
blackfin, microblaze, and sh).

Thanks for pulling!

when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
