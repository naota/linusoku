Well, if the drivers provided with the kernel don't work out of the box
anymore, maybe we should also move them to a separate repository. All it
is going to do otherwise is to cause invalid bug reports because users
don't understand why using the latest driver does not work.

That way it would be clear that an in-kernel driver has to be self-sustaining
to be maintainable, otherwise it has nothing to do there.

Just my 2 cents,
Willy
