Another option then?

All right, new :-)

If the features are widely used, they'll provide a way of masking them either I guess.

AFAIK, Intel added CPUID faulting for their newest 'Ivy Bridge' models, which allows masking all CPUID functions. Unfortunately, I don't have such a CPU. But later this feature can be utilized and wired into the code.

Anyway, masking of at least some of the features would be better than lacking of the ability at all, wouldn't it? Another question whether the kernel should report errors/warnings if a particular feature can't be masked.
