I don't think it's worth it. With ioeventfd we have the same issue
and we don't care: userspace should just DEASSIGN before close.
With irqfd we committed to support cleanup by close but
it happens kind of naturally since we poll irqfd anyway.

It's there for irqfd for historical reasons.

I actually think we should just fix it. Scan eoifds when closing/opening
irqfds and bind/unbind source id.

Hmm, another API rewrite, when I felt it is finally stabilizing. Maybe
it's the right thing to do but it does feel like we change userspace ABI
just because we have run into an implementation difficulty.

Pls note I'm offline next week so won't have time to review soon.
