Given that there have been no replies to this thread, and the restart patch has
now been accepted using 'wmt' as the vendor namespace - would it be safe to
assume we should formalize this in the vendor-bindings.txt?

I'd like to try and have basic device tree support added for the next merge
window (or this one if it all goes well :) ), but it relies on the vendor binding being
formalized.

Regards,

Tony P
