Please read the commit log again. I am not saying vhost-blk v.s 
userspace implementation gives 60% improvement. I am saying the 
vhost-blk v.s original vhost-blk gives 60% improvement.


"""
This patch is based on Liu Yuan's implementation with various
improvements and bug fixes. Notably, this patch makes guest notify and
host completion processing in parallel which gives about 60% performance
improvement compared to Liu Yuan's implementation.

Well. With Zach and Dave's new in-kernel aio API, the aio usage in 
kernel is much simpler than in userspace. This a potential reason that 
in kernel one is better than userspace one. I am working on it right 
now. And for block based image, as suggested by Christoph, we can submit 
bio directly. This is another potential reason.

Why can't we just go further to see if we can improve the IO stack from 
guest kernel side all the way down to host kernel side. We can not do 
that if we stick to doing everything in userspace (qemu).
