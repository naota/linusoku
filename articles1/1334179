Presumably.

The general intention is to automatically catch any disk resizing.
As the SCSI stack (used to) ignore these things that was their way
of working around it.

Curiously, though; the aacraid driver is the only one doing this,
plus the process is quite involved (using a proprietary application
for doing so etc).

None of the FC driver do this, despite the fact that resizing a disk
is even easier here.

I even tried to remove that line once, but then got told off by then
Adaptec that I would break their apps.
Since then there's a patch in the SLES kernel for adding a module
option switching off this behaviour.

We should ask Adaptec/PMC-Sierra here.

Cheers,

Hannes
