In fact, many drivers like to use it in its probe() because too long sleep
in probe will slow down kernel boot if driver is built in kernel. During
kernel boot, rootfs is not mounted and user space is not ready, request_firmware
will timeout to cause problem.

Also after introducing work in this function, it is allowed to be called in
atomic context if 'gfp' is passed as GFP_ATOMIC, so I removed the obsolete
comments.

No, the comment above is misleading and not useless, and I think the below
is good:

 *      Asynchronous variant of request_firmware() for user contexts where
 *      it is not possible to sleep for long time or can't sleep at all, depends
 *      on the @gfp flag passed.

Anyway, the original part of 'It can't be called in atomic contexts.' is wrong
and should be removed.
