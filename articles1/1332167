Yes, I am inclined to agree with you. I just thought it was=20
uncharacteristic of a memory corruption error, as can reliably reproduc=
e=20
the bootlog above. What's even more strange is that the issue only=20
arises on one of my two _identical_ development boards.

Enabling HIGHMEM is actually on my TODO list. We have it enabled in our=
=20
release kernel, it's just on in Mainline yet. I'll bring it forward and=
=20
make it the next think I do.

I don't have any allocated time to debug issues which only arise on=20
Snowball. I'm just waiting on another piece of hardware, then I can=20
start testing on the u9540. This issue will be the first thing I test f=
or.

Thanks for your time chaps.
