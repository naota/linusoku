I suspect you are being hit by same bug I was -- delayed stripes never
got processed. If you get into the state where the rebuild isn't
progressing, and you find that increasing the size of the stripe cache
allows the rebuild to proceed (but the filesystem stays wedged), then
that cinches it.

If you can, upgrade to the latest 3.4 stable kernel (3.4.6 right now).
As far as I can see, the latest 3.2 stable does not contain the delayed
stripe fix.

After applying those fixes to my kernel, my MythTV setup over a 5 disk
RAID5 has been pretty solid, where before I was getting lockups every
few days. It still seems to be getting slower over time, but I've not
looked into it yet as it is not as catastrophic as the wedging.

HTH,
Dave
