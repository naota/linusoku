Thank you bestowing that honour upon me :)  Seriously, though, you
were quite right to Cc me on this, it is one of those areas I ought
to know something about (unlike hugetlb reservations, for example).

Please don't be upset if I say that I don't like either of your patches.
Mainly for obvious reasons - I don't like Mel's because anything with
trylock retries and nested spinlocks worries me before I can even start
to think about it; and I don't like Michal's for the same reason as Mel,
that it spreads more change around in common paths than we would like.

But I didn't spend much time thinking through either of them, they just
seemed more complicated than should be needed.  I cannot confirm or deny
whether they're correct - though I still do not understand how mmap_sem
can help you, Mel.  I can see that it will help in your shmdt()ing test,
but if you leave the area mapped on exit, then mmap_sem is not taken in
the exit_mmap() path, so how does it help?

I spent hours trying to dream up a better patch, trying various
approaches.  I think I have a nice one now, what do you think?  And
more importantly, does it work?  I have not tried to test it at all,
that I'm hoping to leave to you, I'm sure you'll attack it with gusto!

If you like it, please take it over and add your comments and signoff
and send it in.  The second part won't come up in your testing, and could
be made a separate patch if you prefer: it's a related point that struck
me while I was playing with a different approach.

I'm sorely tempted to leave a dangerous pair of eyes off the Cc,
but that too would be unfair.
