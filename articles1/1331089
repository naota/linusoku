As I think more about it, existence of aliases could also potentially 
create confusion where someone adding new code to kernel chooses to use 
the long name instead. Maybe unless we can make a clean break from long 
names, it is not worth doing this and that is going to be problematic 
because of the existing usage in userspace programs.

Matthew, do you have a different point of view?
