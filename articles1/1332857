How do you retain git history?  Git relies entirely on the git client to
notice the rename or excision within a single commit - and this seems to work.

No history derivation clues are stored in the git repo.  It only stores that
the tree was at point A and is now at point B.  How it got there is not
recorded.

That's just a macro for "mv; git rm; git add", I believe.

Fix how?  The Kbuild files say these headers must exist in UAPI space, but the
__KERNEL__ guards therein don't define any content for them in UAPI.

Yeah.  The problem was that the header following the guard also might not be
such, but as you say, checking for:

	copyright
	author
	licen[sc]e
	GPL
	warranty
	warranties
	merchantability
	liability

in the comment might well work.

I see.

Hmmm.  Well, the virtio_console.h comment can actually be suitably modified to
get rid of the bit about __KERNEL__ for the UAPI file, I think.

It's looking like any comment that mentions one or more of the key words above
should be duplicated.

Ummm... no, there shouldn't be any.

Certainly the marker has worked (the __KERNEL__ guard got retained), but I'm
not sure why it didn't get removed.  Probably my understanding of the black
magic required to make perl do what I want is lacking.
