Hm, I thought it was actually you that mentioned that this particular
feature of APM caused some systems to fail...

Unfortunately quiet bugzilla doesn't tell us the difference between
"solid as a rock and used by millions of users every day"
and "nobody anywhere running new software on this old hardware".

Do you have an APM system that boots a 2012 kernel?
Are you willing to test new kernels on it?

At your request 16 months ago, we did exactly that.
Further, we added build-time and run-time warnings and all they did
was cause distro mis-merges and requests to remove the warnings.

16 months ago we came within inches of dropping APM entirely,
as Stephen said he hadn't maintained it for a long time.
Jiri volunteered to look after it, and Pavel offered
that he had 1 surviving machine someplace that actually
supports APM, though I don't know if boots.

I don't dispute that there may be some APM systems running someplace,
but if nobody is going to test a 2012 kernel on such hardware,
then we are kidding ourselves if we say we "support" today's kernel on it.
Also, the whole idea was even if we do support such HW, this patch
is supposed to make that HW more stable, not less stable.
