That makes sense from a technical point of view, but I think it's
going to cause maintenance issues.  For example, assume PLX NTB
support is added.  Will PLX be happy about having to convince you to
accept changes?  Will Intel be happy about having to release a new
driver for their hardware just to incorporate a PLX bug fix?  Will
users of PLX hardware accept a new driver release that only benefits
Intel users?
