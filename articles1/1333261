I don't understand this patch.  The original
ad2b8e601099a23dffffb53f91c18d874fe98854 commit touched the file
mm/memcontrol.c and seemed to do something quite different from what you
have done below.

I'm all for fixing things in a different way than what was done in
Linus's tree, IF there is a reason to, but the comparison between these
two patches (yours and upstream) are not making any sense at all.

confused,

greg k-h
