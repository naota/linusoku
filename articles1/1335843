Do you mean convince Intel? Well, if we think of ntb as the class
driver then the onus is on the community to vet the changes and NOT
intel.
And since this is the first NTB part for which the support is
introduced the class driver design could be a moving target. As
someone else mentioned, the async/sync tx-dma is another hook that
could change the class driver's design.

May be till the class driver is stable, the client(intel/PLX) drivers
might have to be modified.  This is a cue for other vendors to
chime-in and review this design?
Just thinking if this could sit in staging for some time(so that
others get a chance to review/suggest changes as well) and then get
promoted out of staging.
