Howdy Minchan,

Once again, thanks for raising such valuable feedback over here.

This check point was set in place because isolate_balloon_page() was a publicly
visible function and while our current usage looks correct it would not hurt to
have something like that done -- think of it as an insurance policy, in case
someone else, in the future, attempts to use it on any other place outside this
specifc context. 
Despite not seeing it as a dealbreaker for the patch as is, I do agree, however,
this snippet can _potentially_ be removed from isolate_balloon_page(), since
this function has become static to compaction.c.

As we are coping with a corner case -- balloon pages are not on LRU lists --
compaction concurrency can lead to a disastrous race which results in
isolate_balloon_page() re-isolating already isolated balloon pages, or isolating
a 'newpage' recently promoted to 'balloon page', while these pages are still
under migration. The only way we have to prevent that from happening is
attempting to grab the page lock, as pages under migration are already locked.
I had that comment rephrased to what follows (please, tell me how it sounds to
you now)
  	if (likely(get_page_unless_zero(page))) {
 		/*
-		 * We can race against move_to_new_page() & __unmap_and_move().
-		 * If we stumble across a locked balloon page and succeed on
-		 * isolating it, the result tends to be disastrous.
+		 * As balloon pages are not isolated from LRU lists, several
+		 * concurrent compaction threads will potentially race against
+		 * page migration at move_to_new_page() & __unmap_and_move().
+		 * In order to avoid having an already isolated balloon page
+		 * being (wrongly) re-isolated while it is under migration,
+		 * lets be sure we have the page lock before proceeding with
+		 * the balloon page isolation steps.
 		 */
 		if (likely(trylock_page(page))) {
 			/*

This check point is in place by the same reason why it is for
isolate_balloon_page(). However, I don't think we should drop it here because
putback_balloon_page() is still a publicly visible symbol. Besides, the check
that is performed at putback_lru_pages() level has a different meaning, which is
to warn us when we fail on re-inserting an isolated (but not migrated) page back
to the balloon page list, thus it does not superceeds nor it's superceeded by
this checkpoint here.

This can be done, for sure. Also, it reminds me that I had a
'likely(PageLRU(page))' set in place for this vary same patch, on v2 submission.
Do you recollect you've asked me to get rid of it?. Wouldn't it be better having
that suggestion of yours reverted, since PageLRU(page) is the likelihood case
here anyway? What about this?

   " if (likely(PageLRU(page))) { 
       ... 
     } else if (unlikely(is_balloon_page(page))) {
       ...
     } else
	continue;

Despite being a very nice cleanup, this code refactoring has nothing to do with
this particular patch purpose. For the sake of this implementation, think about
the balloon page list acting as a particular LRU, so although ballooned pages
are not enlisted on real LRUs, per se, this doesn't mean we cannot have them
dealt as a corner case amongst putback_lru_pages() code for the sake of
simplicity and maintainability ease. OTOH, I do agree with your nice suggestion,
thus I can submit it as a separate clean-up patch attached to this series (if
you don't mind).

Do you mean perform an extra put_page() and let putback_lru_page() do the rest?
Besides looking odd at code level, what other improvement we can potentially gain here?

I strongly believe, this is the simplest and easiest way to get this task
accomplished, mostly becasue:
  i. It does not require any code duplication at all;
 ii. It requires very few code insertion/surgery to be fully operative;
iii. It is embeded on already well established and maintained code;
 iv. The approach makes easier to other balloon drivers leverage compaction
code;
  v. It shows no significative impact to the entangled code paths;


It took me a little longer to address all your good questions because I
collected some data on this series impact for the ordinary average use case
(bare-metal boxes with no balloon at all). Here are some very simple numbers,
for the sake of comparison:

* Benchmark: "echo 1 > /proc/sys/vm/compact_memory" after a fresh reboot.
* Results represent the average of 4 sampling rounds for each test subject.

Despite the patched case apparently showing some low overhead, the numbers, in
proportion, are virtually the same, as one may notice.
In fact, I believe that applying your suggestions on better hinting the compiler
about the branch predictability can potentially turn this change into a win-win
deal.

Best regards!
