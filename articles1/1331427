I agree with MST here that tcm_vhost needs a clear way to indicate that
ABI changes are likely to occur in transmit from staging -> post-staging
status.

So Linus has merged target-pending/for-next this afternoon, so now we
are just waiting on net-next to hit mainline with the vhost patches
already ACK'ed by MST.  Hopefully that makes things easier for you to
considering taking tcm_vhost upstream via staging.  ;)

Also, MST asked for an RFC-v5 for the initial merge commit with some
minor debug wrapper changes that will be going out next week.  This will
include a move into drivers/staging/tcm_vhost/ against a rebased
staging.git patch with the necessary -rc0 mainline dependencies.

Please let me know if your OK with this, otherwise I'll just plan to
keep -v5 against target-pending/for-next-merge for now, and send a GIT
PULL after MST gets back from holiday on the 29th -> 30th.

After sleeping on this, I'm wondering if there is not something else we
could do at the QEMU level to require an explicit 'development=1' flag
in order to use vhost-scsi while tcm_vhost is still marked as staging
code..?

QEMU folks, would you be open to something like this..?

Thank you,
