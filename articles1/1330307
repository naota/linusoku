I believe that Arnd's point was about the hardware that WonderMedia
chips have inherited from their VIA ancestors, like NAND, SD/MMC,
graphics engine, USB EHCI glue, PWM, PS/2 controller, parts of PMC
etc. Those would be more appropriately named with something
VIA-specific rather than WMT as the vendor prefix (this would apply
for the PWM and the raster engine, which are unchanged between VT8500
and WM8505, to my knowledge).

On the other hand, all of these parts might well be some kind of
licensed third-party design anyway, which makes this whole VIA vs. WMT
a bikeshed discussion mostly. I would personally not feel too guilty
about calling some device that first appeared in a VT8xxx chip 'wmt'
until there's technical reason for different 'compatible' strings
matching different chip versions (VIA age vs. WMT age). So far, we
don't have that need.

Best,
Alexey
