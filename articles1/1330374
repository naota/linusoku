From: Rik van Riel <riel@redhat.com>

commit e0887c19b2daa140f20ca8104bdc5740f39dbb86 upstream.

Stable note: Not tracked on Bugzilla. THP and compaction was found to
	aggressively reclaim pages and stall systems under different
	situations that was addressed piecemeal over time. Paragraph
	3 of this changelog is the motivation for this patch.

When suffering from memory fragmentation due to unfreeable pages, THP page
faults will repeatedly try to compact memory.  Due to the unfreeable
pages, compaction fails.

Needless to say, at that point page reclaim also fails to create free
contiguous 2MB areas.  However, that doesn't stop the current code from
trying, over and over again, and freeing a minimum of 4MB (2UL <<
sc->order pages) at every single invocation.

This resulted in my 12GB system having 2-3GB free memory, a corresponding
amount of used swap and very sluggish response times.

This can be avoided by having the direct reclaim code not reclaim from
zones that already have plenty of free memory available for compaction.

If compaction still fails due to unmovable memory, doing additional
reclaim will only hurt the system, not help.
