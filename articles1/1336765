Sorry, this is more directed at the current round of fixes that are
being sent than the driver itself - the patches to bodge around the
issue are being pushed fairly aggressively as an urgent fix without
even mentioning what the issue is.  I don't have any concerns with
the driver, only with the way it's being fixed.

This sort of reliance on out of tree patches which any real user of the
device would be expected to have sounds like exactly the sort of thing
I'd expect to have caused an issue like this, and obviously the fix here
is to get the clocks in place (even if just as stubs, though I'd expect
there to be a major impact on the functionality of the device if it's
not clocked...) rather than to just bodge out the error checking.

It does also suggest that the DT binding for this device will need to
include the setup of these clocks (I believe the clock bindings for DT
have just gone into mainline this merge window but I'd need to check).
