I've done an extensive audit per Christoph's request, and although of
course this is not enough to guarantee it 100 %, it should at least be
enough to sustain a belief that it should be reasonably safe.

About regressions, yes, it is working. But as you know, this area is
under undergoing change by myself. For kmemcg to work, we need to
explicitly mark instances of __free_pages that are accounted. With this
patch, this is trivial. Without this patch, I need to come up with a
quite ugly hack to mark put_pages as well, that would exist for no
reason aside from "avoid touching this".

I could of course just bundle this is my series, but since this is an
independent change, it is better to send it separate so it get better
review, testing and validation.

I can update the Changelog, no problem.
