Ok, true. Not sure why this was restricted to 32bit when reconsidering. E=
xcept
if in 64bit it was assumed (or asserted) that the regions are aligned to =
2M...
But maybe this can be answered by someone knowing the details. I would no=
t mind
either way (have the first range with 4K pages in all cases or fixing the=

additional PTE allocation). Just as it is now it is inconsistent.
