So this change was re" your comment "This loop we should just port over
into the regmap code." at http://lkml.org/lkml/2012/7/26/466.

I believe the idea is that the chip has an interrupt output from n
sources. Only some of those n sources should trigger a wakeup from
sleep. Hence, the max8907 driver was writing out the "sleep enables" to
the enable registers whenever entering sleep, so that any other IRQ
sources within the chip didn't trigger the chip's interrupt output and
hence exit sleep. If we are to port that code into the regmap-irq core,
it seems to make sense to have enable_base==wake_base, since the same
register truly is being used for both enable/wakeup-enable, just
time-multiplexed.

Or, perhaps the IRQ core already disables all non-wake interrupts for
us, so the driver doesn't have to do this, and we can just drop that
code completely?
