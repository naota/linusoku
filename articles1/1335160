Only if there are no available source IDs.

The only sane way to do that is to pull the eoifd into KVM_IRQFD and set
them up together.  That's actually what v1 of this endeavor did.  My
intention with splitting eoifd from irqfd is that I think EOI
notification is potentially useful outside of this usage with irqfds and
I wanted an interface that could be used independently.  Someday, an
irqfd may not be the only way to generate a key.  Userspace may also
wish to register to receive notification-only for the existing user
source ID.

I do not think it's sane to have an eoifd configured using KVM_EOIFD and
destroyed using KVM_IRQFD.  As for smaller patch, I'm not convinced.  We
still have to watch for POLLHUP, which pulls in the bulk of the code.
And using the above approach of pulling eoifd setup into irqfd we have
to address what happens to the combined set when either eventfd is
closed.  By your argument closing the irqfd closes the eoifd, but does
closing the eoifd necessarily close the irqfd.  If not then we end up
with the question of how can an eoifd be added to an existing irqfd.
