The situation is a bit different on the Macbook Pro 6,2. OS X also 
automatically switches to the DGPU when an external monitor is 
connected, but unlike the 8,2, the IGPU works fine under Linux with 
external monitors if port 0x740 is set accordingly. I'm pretty sure that 
this is also the case with for the older macbooks without dynamic switching.
