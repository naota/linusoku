That expansion doesn't match the macros.  Using the most recent
definitions of DEFINE_HASHTABLE and DEFINE_STATIC_HASHTABLE from above,
the definition would look something like this:

static union {
	struct hash_table my_hashtable;
	struct {
		size_t bits;
		struct hlist_head buckets[1 << 5];
	} __my_hashtable;
} = { .my_hashtable.bits = 5 };

Given the expansion above, you can just write this as
foo(&my_hashtable), which seems sensible to me.
