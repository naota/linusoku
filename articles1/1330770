Running out of fds is also very conceivable.  Not deassigning
before close is a userspace bug anyway.

Looks like this disabling is inherent in what we want eoifd to do.  You
bind irqfd and eoifd. If irqfd is deassigned, eoifd will not get any
more events, it is disabled. Whether it keeps the pointer to source id
internally or not does not matter to the user.

You say it is preferable but I wonder what does it buy users compared to
using the fd directly - it is certainly more work for userspace to keep
track of it.
