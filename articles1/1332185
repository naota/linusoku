The tests used to support mysql but the code bit-rotted and eventually
got deleted. I'm not going to get into a mysql vs postgres discussion on
which is better :O

Were you thinking of mysql or something else as an alternative?
Completely different test?

I did not check the source, but even if it is true then your comments only
applies to testing scalability of locking. If someone really cares to check,
the postgres version was 9.0.4. However, even if they are using user-space
locking, the test is still useful for looking at the IO performance,
page reclaim decisions and so on.
