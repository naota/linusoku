The more I think about this, the more I prefer the way the way it is in
the patch I posted.

I don't think it's appropriate to put this support into the IRQ core.
The main issue is that all the handlers for any shared wired-or
interrupt line have to be registered before the IRQ is enabled, to avoid
some initially active interrupt continually firing before the IRQ is
enabled. Co-ordinating this when the wired-or line is on a board outside
a device driver rather than internal to a chip and one device driver is
a bit more than the IRQ core should probably be doing, hence I imagine
why it doesn't support it.

Co-ordinating this setup where all the sources of the wired-or are in
one chip seems to belong to the chip driver, which is where my patch did
this.

I guess I could modify regmaps_irq_thread() so that instead of:

	for (i = 0; i < d->nchips; i++)
		handle_nested_irq(irq_find_mapping(d->irqdom, i));

... it short-circuited and instead did something like:

	for (i = 0; i < d->nchips; i++)
		regmap_irq_thread(irq_find_mapping(d->irqdom, i),
			d->datas[i]);

but it seems a little hokey to short-circuit the IRQ core; it would
prevent execution of any statistics gathering or stuck interrupt
handling that handle_nested_irq() might do for example.

Now, if we made each child regmap_irq not be its own IRQ domain or
irq_chip, but simply had one top-level domain/chip that aggregated them,
that argument would be moot. However, that top-level domain/chip would
become rather complex and just end up doing a bunch of demultiplexing
code that's not needed if we do it like in my patch...
