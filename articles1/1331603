I think I got your and peter's opinion, so we could not make sure the
kernel could still work well if some flags was enabled because their
behave are always changing, and it's impossible to maintain such
volatile feature.

Actually I got this idea after reading:

http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=130822782111533

But looks like I don't get the point, so what we want is building the
domain according to some system topology designed by producer?
