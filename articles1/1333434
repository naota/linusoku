The first sentence implies to me that you consider the patch
fine as is, yet the last phrase makes me rather think you want
it adjusted as per Yinghai's response.

In any case, address capping by the chipset doesn't matter
here, all we're after is determining how may bits the MTRRs
(or equivalents) implement (so that size_or_mask and
size_and_mask end up being correct).

Bottom line - I'm confused as to what (if any) adjustments
the patch needs in order to be acceptable.
