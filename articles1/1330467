Doh - S2R. I don't do persistent hibernate here (writing some 1GB of data
to flash-based storage each time possibly isn't all too healthy anyway).

Will retry soonish.

Maybe I can get this successfully off the machine next time,
by pre-caching required binaries prior to initiating a non-working resume.

OK - so you're trying in vain to tell dense me that I'm supposed to
take note of the *non-changing* (i.e., correctly "persistent")
USB device ID scheme rather than the roguely changing device nodes.
To which I say that unfortunately I don't have a pre/post comparison
at this moment yet.

Ah, yeah - I tend to know *this* other effect, too...

Thanks a ton for your reply!
Now I know that there's a tendency to better look on the other side
(block device layer etc.) and analyze things there,
once it's established that USB topology ID numbering in fact did persist.
