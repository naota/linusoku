The serial console on some of these phones are accessed via the 
headphone jack.

Imagine an airline provides free noise cancelling headphones for 
flights. Those headphones are of course "smart" and covertly try to 
quickly capture data off of the phone's debugger interface, storing on 
some headphone internal flash, all without the user noticing.

So I think Colin's concerns (regardless of any paranoia about phone 
OEM's intentions) is reasonable.
