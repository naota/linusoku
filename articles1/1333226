The picture confused me. It looked like the first element is the virtio_scsi_cmd_req
not an sgilist-element that points to the struct's buffer.

In that case then yes your plan of making a two-elements fragment that points to the
original scsi-sglist is perfect. All you have to do is that, and all you have to do
at virtio is use the sg_for_each macro and you are done.

You don't need any sglist allocation or reshaping. And you can easily support
chaining. Looks like order of magnitude more simple then what you do now
So what is the problem?

And BTW you won't need that new __sg_set_page API anymore.
