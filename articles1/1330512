On the contrary, your patch set could make the existing problems worse
by introducing lot of complexity (makes the execution path very long for
each and every one these messages) in the path that prints messages. As
more and more acpi code paths start using the new interfaces, it will
keep getting worse.

I am not questioning the usefulness of the additional information, I am
questioning the complexity your patch set adds. The added complexity
isn't desirable.

The design in this patch set needs refinement so it doesn't add to the
execution path.
