Oh, but that was precisely the point; the reason it does not hold true
is due to sensor and discretization errors. If we can improve upon
this situation, we get a better model of reality.

Probably a simple filter will work. If the bounding box is moving too
fast for the tracked point to stay in the right corner, the solution
is to use a smaller time step. In practise, keeping the tracked point
as a state in the driver, and updating the bounding box using box ->
(1 - m) box + m box_new. If the tracked point is in the right corner,
let m =3D 1. If not, choose a smaller m.

Propagating information about various sensor defects to userspace
sounds horrid to me. The sooner we can forget about these devices, the
better.

I am not entirely opposed to this solution, but I would much rather
see an attempt to improve the bounding box in the driver, since such a
solution could be useful for other devices as well.
