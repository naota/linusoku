Given that I don't even know the limitations, that's a bit tough.  As
a general rule, I would always prefer netconsole.  It appears to be
more reliable than blockconsole and beats serial console by half a
lightyear.  But as a fallback when netconsole is not realistic,
blockconsole has proven useful.

Below is a compile-tested patch to do that.  Feel free to give it a
spin and fix any bugs.

That appears to be slightly less likely than crossbreeding a rabbit
with a chicken.  Is there something obvious I have missed?
