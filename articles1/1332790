Actually, as I was about to do the adjustment, this isn't correct:
Both mask_hi and base_hi get shifted left in some calculations
there, and hence they would require up-casts to unsigned long
if their type would remain a 32-bit one. Further, mask_lo gets
or-ed with size_or_mask, which is u64, the result compared
with tmp (now unsigned long), and the same result also negated
so the *size (also unsigned long), so needs to be unsigned long
itself unless we want to introduce another variable.

That leaves only base_lo as a candidate for remaining 32-bit,
but for consistency I think it would be better to have them all
have the same type.

Consequently I think the patch should remain as is.
