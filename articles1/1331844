Of course. There are some build errors right now under certain
configurations with apple-gmux. That's a bug, and the patch I sent fixes
it. I'll test the patches that add switcheroo support for build failures
under relevant configurations, but I'm not expecting any new problems
since vga_switcheroo provides stubs when it's disabled.
