Sounds interesting :)
I guess you traced BIOS events, right?

Since ftrace itself is a tracing feature in the linux kernel, it
can trace two or more applications (processes) if those run on linux
kernel. However, I think OpenBIOS runs *under* the guest kernel.
If so, ftrace currently can't trace OpenBIOS from guest side.

I think it may need another enhancement on both OpenBIOS and linux
kernel to trace BIOS event from linux kernel.

Of course, virtio-serial itself can open multiple channels, thus, if
OpenBIOS can handle virtio, it can pass trace data via another
channel.

I guess your feature notifies events to QEMU and QEMU records that in
their own buffer. Therefore it must have different tracepoint IDs.
On the other hand, with this feature, QEMU just passes trace-data to
host-side pipe. Since outer tracing tool separately collects trace
data, we don't need to demultiplex the data.

Perhaps, in the analyzing phase (after tracing), we have to mix events
again. At that time, we'll add some guest-ID for each event-ID, but
it can be done offline.
