I understand the reason why you think 3 or 4 logs are reasonable.
There are some cases  2nd or 3rd oops is critical....

I have some enterprise customers who are sensitive for a software failure  and specify panic_on_oops=1.
In this case, they don't need 3,4 logs. 2 logs  are enough.

So, kernel parameter should be as follows.

Log_num =1
  - For users who want to hold just one log.

Log_num=2
  - For users who can handle multiple logs and 1st oops is concerned. (by specifying panic_on_oops=1)

Log_num=3,4
 -  for users who care about 2nd or 3rd oops.

Log_num=5 or more
Invalid value.

If there is misunderstanding, please let me know.
