I'm happy once it's fixed!

If there is another race then it is best to hear about it, understand
it and fix the underlying problem. More importantly, your patch ensures
that two processes faulting at the same time will share page tables with
each other. My patch only noted that this missed opportunity could cause
problems with fork.

It could do with a small comment above huge_pmd_share() explaining that
calling pmd_alloc() under the i_mmap_mutex is necessary to prevent two
parallel faults missing a sharing opportunity with each other but it's
not mandatory.

I vote yours
