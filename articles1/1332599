hi Jason

( Kay, I previously mis-addressed you at vrfy.com, so you havent received the
thread directly until now. sorry about that)

yes mostly - depending upon what "these" are.

Changing the prefix delimiter (I chose dot since its used in nested
names everywhere)
definitely improves the situation, with this patch the field-count variation is
0 or 1 for dyndbg==p or dyndbg==p[fmlt]+ respectively

It obviously doesnt address colons which may be added elsewhere;
pr_fmt() KBUILD_MODNAME ":" __func__  adds another,
and dev_printk adds several, depending on the device type

Its reasonable to change all the pr_fmt() delimiters to dot also,
but thats a lot of touches to a lot of modules (ie churn), and
probably isnt worth doing
unless its done fully, which would need a solid consensus that its
worth the trouble.

changing delimiters inside dev_printk() / dev_driver_string() is harder;
it means changing values in low level fields
                        (dev->bus ? dev->bus->name :
                        (dev->class ? dev->class->name : ""));

which are also exposed to user-space, forex by lspci etc

]$ lspci | cut -c 1-20
00:00.0 Host bridge:
00:07.0 PCI bridge:
00:11.0 SATA control
00:12.0 USB Controll
00:14.0 SMBus: ATI T
00:14.1 IDE interfac
00:14.2 Audio device
00:14.3 ISA bridge:
00:14.4 PCI bridge:

That looks like a can of worms best left closed.


So this patch only addresses dyndbg prefix, and is 95% resolved.
the remaining 0-1 variation isnt really important - almost all dyndbg users
will want some prefix - at least module, so the missing field in dyndbg==p
is pretty inconsequential, and its typically provided by pr_fmt() anyway.


In any case, I think ths patch does what is practical now, and no more.
If you agree, the patch needs your Ackd-by before Greg will take it.


Going forward, the proper priorities for dyndbg are IMO (CMIIW)

- get jumplabels working

  Ive coded this, and it looks ok, but Im stuck on the circular
include problem seen
  when I add #include <linux/jumplabel.h> needed for the ddebug.key field.
  Ive tried a few permutations, but I dont think thats gonna
illuminate a working fix.
  I think I'll post a minimal RF-Help patch to demonstrate the problem ..

- propose a pr_debug_flags("flagchars", "fmt", ...)

  "flagchars" would be uppercase chars defined for each module
  DBG_DEFINE_FLAG( mod_debug_str, "A", "alpha flag controls .. blah blah..");

  I think this could be made to work for both dyndbg and non-dyndbg:
  $ echo A > /sys/module/modname/parameters/dbg_str
  $ echo module modname +pA > /dbg/dynamic_debug/control

This needs more thought, and perhaps simplification,
but it seems appropriate to see if dyndbg and non-dyndbg can be made
to fit together cogently from a user perspective.
