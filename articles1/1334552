There can be two reasons try_to_grab_pending() can fail with -EAGAIN.
One is when someone else is queueing or deqeueing the work item.  With
the previous patches, it is guaranteed that PENDING and queued state
will soon agree making it safe to busy-retry in this case.

The other is if multiple __cancel_work_timer() invocations are racing
one another.  __cancel_work_timer() grabs PENDING and then waits for
running instances of the target work item on all CPUs while holding
PENDING and !queued.  try_to_grab_pending() invoked from another task
will keep returning -EAGAIN while the current owner is waiting.

Not distinguishing the two cases is okay because __cancel_work_timer()
is the only user of try_to_grab_pending() and it invokes
wait_on_work() whenever grabbing fails.  For the first case, busy
looping should be fine but wait_on_work() doesn't cause any critical
problem.  For the latter case, the new contender usually waits for the
same condition as the current owner, so no unnecessarily extended
busy-looping happens.  Combined, these make __cancel_work_timer()
technically correct even without preemption protection while grabbing
PENDING or distinguishing the two different cases.

While the current code is technically correct, not distinguishing the
two cases makes it difficult to use try_to_grab_pending() for other
purposes than canceling because it's impossible to tell whether it's
safe to busy-retry grabbing.

This patch adds a mechanism to mark a work item being canceled.
try_to_grab_pending() now requires the caller to have preemption
disabled and returns -EAGAIN to indicate that grabbing failed but
PENDING and queued states are gonna agree soon and it's safe to
busy-loop.  It returns -ENOENT if the work item is being canceled and
it may stay PENDING && !queued for arbitrary amount of time.

__cancel_work_timer() is modified to mark the work canceling with
WORK_OFFQ_CANCELING after grabbing PENDING, thus making
try_to_grab_pending() fail with -ENOENT instead of -EAGAIN.  Also, it
invokes wait_on_work() iff grabbing failed with -ENOENT.  This isn't
necessary for correctness but makes it consistent with other future
users of try_to_grab_pending().
