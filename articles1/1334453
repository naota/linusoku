Yes, I converted a few DPRINTFs to tracepoints as a proof of concept.

No, OpenBIOS boots the machine and then passes control to boot loader
and that to kernel. The kernel will make a few calls to OpenBIOS at
start but not later. OpenBIOS is used by QEMU as Sparc and PowerPC
BIOS.

Ideally both OpenBIOS and Linux should be able to feed trace events
back to QEMU independently.

Currently OpenBIOS probes the PCI bus and identifies virtio devices
but ignores them, adding virtio-serial support shouldn't be too hard.
There's a time window between CPU boot and PCI probe when the the
device will not be available though.

Yes, the multiplexing/demultiplexing is only needed in my version
because the feeds are not independent.
