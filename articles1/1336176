Thank you very much for working on this! Much appreciated!

I leave this to the vb2 experts. It's not obvious to me why we would need
a fourth memory allocator.

Did you run the latest v4l2-compliance tool from the v4l-utils.git repository
over your driver? I'm sure you didn't since VIP is missing support for control
events and v4l2-compliance would certainly complain about that.

Always check with v4l2-compliance whenever you make changes! It's continuously
improved as well, so a periodic check wouldn't hurt.

Also take a look at the new vb2 helper functions in media/videobuf2-core.h:
it is likely that you can use those to simplify your driver. They are used in
e.g. vivi, so take a look there.
