So I was worried that you were trying to remove the SEMI_MT flag, and I 
apologise for not looking closely enough to notice that wasn't the case. 
The documentation for the flag says:

"""
Some touchpads, most common between 2008 and 2011, can detect the 
presence of multiple contacts without resolving the individual 
positions; only the number of contacts and a rectangular shape is known. 
For such touchpads, the semi-mt property should be set.

Depending on the device, the rectangle may enclose all touches, like a 
bounding box, or just some of them, for instance the two most recent 
touches. The diversity makes the rectangle of limited use, but some 
gestures can normally be extracted from it.
"""

Since the documentation doesn't say the data must be provided as min/max 
values, this patch actually appears to be perfectly fine as is.

My next question is: how are you going to tell from userspace if the 
hardware actually provides correct data? IIRC, it was decided that we 
wouldn't provide sysfs nodes for the device IDs.
