Hey,

Linus released this Saturday v3.5 and there were quite a few
of interesting components/fixes/features that went in!

Going to go down the list of what shortlog provided:
 - Less MSR traps when using AMD machines - so better performance. [andre]
 - The APIC IPI interface works - which means that 'perf' in the initial
   domain works. So no more lockups. Also with some tweaks, that means kdb
   can work as well [ben]
 - Static analyzer fixes in hvc [dan]
 - The march to make HVM domains driver domains continue - the XenBus
   in the initial domain can now search for it in another domain instead
   of assuming its in the initial domain [daniel]. Marek also expanded netfront
   to now work in initial domain. [marek]
 - Memory reported by 'xm list' for the initial domain now matches what
   the kernel has been booted with. In the past it would be around 1GB
   less due to the kernel releasing memory that fall within
   E820 gaps/PCI space [david and me]
 - The bootup on two-socket or more of AMD cpus works correctly (I put
   in a temporary way in v3.4) but Lin implemented the correct way [lin, jeremy and me]
 - Make xen-blkfront capable of unloading. This requires some extra
   infrastructure work to handle delayed grants [jan]
 - Fixes in the hvc drivers for PVonHVM guests started with 'xm' (not xl!) would
   fail during migration. [me]
 - Fix in blkback with discard operation in 32/64 (so 32-bit guest, 64-bit dom0) mix would fail.
 - Support for 'perf' to work in the initial domain [lin]
 - PVonHVM guests on their reboot would not release properly event channels
   so would consume additional memory [stefano]
 - Make it possible for the upstream QEMU run in the initial domain along with
   blkfront (and blkback) to allow QCOW images to be mapped [stefano]
 - Fix for mulitple PCI domains to not crash during bootup [zhang]
 - Fix to make FLR actually do properly FLR in xen-pciback. [me]
