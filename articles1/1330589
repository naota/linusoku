The ioctl shouldn't be needed anymore for PCI or USB devices, as the
kernel handles the matching of the driver to the device.  Even if it
didn't, there are other more "standard" ways that you can bind devices
to drivers (through sysfs.)

So, I'd really recommend ripping all of this logic out for PCI drivers
as odds are, it's not used, and probably doesn't really work.

For old ISA cards, it makes sense, but the odds that anyone uses any ISA
devices is pretty slim.
