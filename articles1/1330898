This approach looks more or less like what I was expecting. I like that
the trick was applied to the page table page instead of using PTE tricks
or by bodging it with a VMA flag like I was thinking so kudos for that. I
also prefer this approach to trying to free the page tables on or near
huge_pmd_unshare()

In general I think this patch would execute better than mine because it is
far less heavy-handed but I share your concern that it changes the core MM
quite a bit for a corner case that only one architecture cares about. I am
completely biased of course, but I still prefer my patch because other than
an API change it keeps the bulk of the madness in arch/x86/mm/hugetlbpage.c
. I am also not concerned with the scalability of how quickly we can setup
page table sharing.

Hugh, I'm afraid you get to choose :)
