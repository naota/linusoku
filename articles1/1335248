Yes could be, that would explain the 2 stack trace ( and the different
timing observed )
Bisection is in progress. The fallocate bug is certainly already
corrected ( info sent by
sunil.mushran@gmail.com but unavailable on the list for the moment  ?)

------

The fallocate() oops is probably the same that is fixed by this patch.

2118b301104a24381b414bc93371d666fe8d43a


Is in the list of patches that are ready to be pushed.

mw-3.4-mar15

----

But not sure it will correct all i observed. So i will continue to
bisect to confirm/infirm.
( But i seems to have lost network on my server after a reboot and so n=
o
more access before tomorrow , I have certainly forget to do make
modules_install before installing new kernel ... Being stupid is not
very helpful... ) . I hope to finish the bisection tomorrow or wednesda=
y.

Thanks a lot for the support.
