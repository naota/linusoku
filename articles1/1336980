Hi Rafael, 

the code in "drivers/pnp/interface.c" implements a (non-trivial) interface
which accepts the keywords "disable", "activate", "fill", "auto", "clear",
and "get" as simple, one word commands.  The remaining "set" command is
more complex, for it determines which resource is to be set ("io", "mem",
"irq", "dma", and "bus"), followed by the actual value(s) of this resource
(e.g., "0x0200-0x021f", or "7"). 

The patch series allows to use the term "disabled" or "<none>" as a 
resource value (c.f. my example above) when needed (c.f. my motivation for
the patch series). 

We could, of course, change the parser in "interface.c", but this would 
change the ABI, I am afraid.  Something that I'd rather not do... 

I hope, this makes the scope of the patch series clear(er).
