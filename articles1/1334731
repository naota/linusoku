Good catch, I just failed to notice it myself :)

Nicely observed, I hadn't thought of that one either.

Yes. it's actually even nicer, because we know since the child is red,
the node being erased is black, and we can thus handle recoloring 'for
free' by setting child to black here instead of going through
__rb_erase_color() later. And if we could do that for all 1-child
cases, it might even be possible to invoke __rb_erase_color() for the
no-childs case only, at which point we can drop one of that function's
arguments. Worth investigating, I think.

Using a helper doesn't hurt, I think. I'm not sure about the unlikely
thing because near-empty trees could be common for some workloads,
which is why I've let it the way it currently is.

Yeah, I've had a quick look at left-leaning RBtrees, but they didn't
seem like an obvious win to me. Plus, I feel like I've been thinking
about rbtrees too much already, so I kinda want to take a vacation
from them at this point :)

Thanks for your remarks, especially the one about one-child coloring
in rb_erase().
