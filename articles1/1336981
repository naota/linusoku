This is applied in many parts of the kernels and has some benefits:
- easy to spot duplicates
- clash is less likely when two commit adds includes
- easy to do so it looks the same across different files

Obviously <linux/*> comes before include <asm/*> as this is
separate blocks of includes.

net/ and arch/x86/ is two places where this is getting the norm,
and these are trendsetters for the rest of the kernel.

Found the following somewhere on the net:

Ok, this discussion has gone on for too long anyway, but let's make it
easier for everybody. The kernel uses u8/u16/u32 because:

	- the kernel should not depend on, or pollute user-space naming.
	  YOU MUST NOT USE "uint32_t" when that may not be defined, and
	  user-space rules for when it is defined are arcane and totally
	  arbitrary.
...

See http://yarchive.net/comp/linux/kernel_headers.html for additional
rationale. (Second mail listed).
