Patches 1-2, 4-15, 20-21, 31-32 correspond to commits included in Linux
3.2.  I've added the rest to the queue for 3.2.y, generally using the
versions Greg has queued for 3.0.39.

Patch 30 'mm: vmscan: convert global reclaim to per-memcg LRU lists'
needed a further context change.

For patch 33 'cpuset: mm: reduce large amounts of memory barrier related
damage v3' I folded in the two fixes Herton pointed out and you
acknowledged, and took the upstream version of the changes to
get_any_partial() in slub.c.

Ben.
