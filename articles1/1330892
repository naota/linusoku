Yes.

While it is true that we don't *really* need page_table_lock here, we are
still updating page tables and it's in line with the the ordinary locking
rules.  There are other cases in hugetlb.c where we do pte_same() checks even
though we are protected from the related races by the instantiation_mutex.

page_table_lock is actually a bit useless for shared page tables. If shared
page tables were every to be a general thing then I think we'd have to
revisit how PTE update locking is done but I doubt anyone wants to dive
down that rat-hole.

For now, I'm going to keep taking it even if strictly speaking it's not
necessary.

Fair point. If we go with this version of the fix, I'll improve the
documentation a bit.
