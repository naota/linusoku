Yes, we do filter /proc/cpuinfo output in our product (OpenVZ), but 
there is also the LXC project that is based completely on the mainstream 
kernel. LXC developers have not faced the cross-vendor migration problem 
yet because currently they don't have migration at all, but they will 
surely face it in future since the work on migration is in progress now 
(CRIU).

So, you prefer adding some filtering of /proc/cpuinfo into the 
mainstream kernel (not now, later, for LXC to work) instead of enabling 
clearcpuid boot option to mask CPUID features? IMO, the latter would 
look clearer.
