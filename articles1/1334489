Actually I think that we'd prefer to keep this in a patch-based form, at
least for now, because majority of our users get these drivers with
VMware Tools and will continue doing so until ditsributions start
enabling VMCI in their kernels. Which they probably won't until VMCI
moves form staging. We'd also have to constantly adjust drivers that we
are not working on getting upstream at this time to work with the
rapidly changing version of VMCI in staging, which will just add work
for us.

So we'd like to get more feedback and have a chance to address issues
and then decide whether staying in staging makes sense or not.

Thanks.
