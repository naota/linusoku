In fact, I mean the function can be called in atomic context now, and
I know some time ago the function will create kthread to execute
the request_firmware, and atomic context is not allowed.

So I remove the obsolete comment.

The function can be run in both contexts, and I don't see any words which
says the function will sleep.

It is the original one, and I don't think it is wrong. Also it
shouldn't be covered

Maybe I shouldn't have fixed the comment in this patch.
