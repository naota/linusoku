No, I wasn't trying to correct you, just making that aspect explicit;
I don't often hear anyone else use the term "swappable" at all.

That sounds just like what I was suggesting in my last sentence:
let userspace manage a tmpfs hierarchy parallel to the cgroupfs one.

Except, perhaps, where I assume "userspace" should be doing the hard work.

So systemd is already doing it as I suggested, but finds that awkward in
some respects, and wants more help from the kernel in synchronization.

Stuffing an unbounded amount of data into cgroupfs xattrs doesn't sound
the right way to go.

I wonder if it could be turned completely on its head, and the cgroupfs
parts be represented in xattrs on a tmpfs hierarchy?  The data contents of
the tmpfs files being entirely up to userspace i.e. systemd in ths case.
