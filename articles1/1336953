You shouldn't have any extra indirection for the base, if it lives
immediately after the size.  You should only have a single extra
indirection for the size, and in a workload that uses that hash table
heavily, I'd hope that cache line sticks around.

Also, if you want to use a fixed-size "L1" hash table to reduce
indirections, you might as well use a non-chaining hash table to
eliminate another few indirections.

I'd be interested to see the performance numbers for an L1 hash that
doesn't cheat by skipping synchronization. :)  If you benchmarked an L1
hash with no synchronization against the existing dcache with its pile
of synchronization, that would make a large difference in performance,
but not necessarily because of a single extra indirection.

The current approach that Sasha and I have iterated on should make the
fixed-size case equally easy and efficient, while also making the
resizable case possible.  Any particular reason not to use that
approach?
