} and during this time I might stick to the API.
I am not at ease telling people how they should take things,
especially if I asked for their help, all the more when they put
efforts within the exchange while being expert on the matter, yet
please, do not assume I did not care for your advices, which I deem of
the most valuable, as, needless to say, do the community.

Merge submission while taking such liberties .. that I would not dare
;) this really was a down to the ground technical question not the
start of a disguised start of a merging request.

I am sure that taking such liberties and feeling its limits before
sticking to a super safe API is not a bad thing, e.g it might trigger
easierly nasty hidden bugs, it is often beneficial to me at least.

Thanks for your feedback,

Karl
