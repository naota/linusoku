A fifth option is to quirk the driver to remove the pulling effect
from the reported bounding box, such that the simple userspace scheme
for determining the position of the moving finger actually works.

For instance, consider the simple algorithm "the slowest corner is the
stationary finger". As long as this is true, the behavior will be
smooth. If the sensor data clutters this behavior, it shows up in the
driver as a mismatch between the point as computed above and the
better estimate available in the driver. For frames where this
happens, one can simply alter the bounding box slightly so that the
algorithm works.

It should be possible to formulate such a scheme in a couple of lines.
