Sorry for taking so long to reply. I am really not that familiar with the
power domain requirements, but I do have two comments on your approach:

* I think when we want to add a generic concept to the device tree such
  as power domains, we should always make it specified in a generic way.
  You have used the "renesas,pmdomain" attribute, which is specific to
  one vendor and requires platform specific code to read it.
  Is there any reason not to put the code into the generic
  drivers/base/power/domain.c file (or near it) and make a binding that
  works for everyone?

* Mark suggested two options (string and phandle), and (you guessed it),
  I would much prefer the other one.
  IMHO using phandle makes it much easier to do this in a generic way,
  without having to document every possible string that this can be
  set to in the binding document. Obviously the phandle requires having
  a node in the device tree for each domain, but I think having that
  node is actually an advantage because it lets you describe the
  hierarchy of the domains there.
