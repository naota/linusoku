Just to expand on this a bit since I've found myself pushing back in
this sort of way far too often with these recent serieses and it's
making everyone grumpy:

What I'm seeing here is a lot of patches getting sent with problems that
I'd really not expect from someone sending such a high volume of
patches.  Things like the lack of documentation for the DT bindings for
example, it's something that's mandatory and which people doing lots of
device tree work really ought to be aware of.  There's also noticable
pushback with fixing some of these issues, and like I say this happens
often enough to be really noticeable.

This isn't awesome from a review point of view, it's not nice to find
issues in things and when it happens a lot for the wrong sort of thing
it ends up seeming like the time spent doing the reviews isn't valued.
