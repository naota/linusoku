Not true at all.  You want those drivers to be merged as well, right?
So they will need to have their functions changed, and their code as
well.

Just wait until we get to the "change your functionality around"
requests, those will require those drivers to change.  Right now we are
at the "silly and obvious things you did wrong" stage of the review
process :)

So please fix these, and also, post these drivers as well, so we can see
how they interact with the core code.

Actually, if you are going to need lots of refactoring for these
drivers, and the core, I would recommend putting this all in the staging
tree, to allow that to happen over time.  That would ensure that your
users keep having working systems, and let you modify the interfaces
better and easier, than having to keep it all out-of-tree.

What do you think?
