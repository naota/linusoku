That sounds like a pretty good idea, aside from the fact that now your
config is determined by 1) what is currently installed on your system
and 2) people that don't maintain the kernel.

1 is obviously a great thing once you have a stable working set of
packages you use daily, but wouldn't it kind of suck to have to rebuild
the kernel just to install some new package?  I mean... say you wanted
to now use an NFS mount, but you didn't have nfs-utils previously
installed.  So you install it, and it plops the kconfig file in
/usr/share but oops, you have to rebuild the kernel and reboot because
that module isn't built.  Of course I'm extrapolating possibly the worst
usage case here, but it will still happen.

2... yeah.  I don't really know if that is going to pan out, but I am
ever hopeful.  I'd be mostly concerned with people that are coding
userspace applications using every whiz-bang kernel feature.  Or not
paying attention at all to the kernel after the initial file creation
and the options going stale (don't follow renames, etc).

The definition of minimum seems to be what we're disagreeing on.  I'm
approaching it from "minimum for a default install of the distro
release".  OK, that and maybe a few common case usages (like NFS, CIFS,
etc).  You seem to be approaching it from literally bare minimum.

Perhaps.  I thought getting it reasonable would benefit more people,
even at the cost of some smaller bloat than bare minimum.  I don't think
either of us are really wrong, it's more a matter of who is really going
to use this and why I guess.
