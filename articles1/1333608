Ok, here's what I got from looking at the patch:

Your commit message says: "Also request_firmware_nowait should be called
in atomic context now, so fix the obsolete comments."

Atomic context in my book means you're not allowed to sleep at all.

But the comment says that it is possible to sleep a little. This is very
wrongly formulated AFAICT.

But, since request_firmware_nowait receives a GFP mask as one of its
arguments and some of its callers don't supply GFP_ATOMIC then this
has nothing to do with atomic contexts at all. Then, you should simply
explain in the comment why exactly callers aren't allowed to be sleeping
for a long time. And using adjectives like "long" or "short" is very
misleading in such explanations so please be more specific as to why the
callers shouldn't be sleeping for extended periods of time.

I hope I'm making sense here...
