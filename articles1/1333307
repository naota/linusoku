Yes, you're right.

At the time I wrote the changelog I had patches belonging to 3.5 included. I
later decided to drop them until after 3.5 was out. It was potentially
weird to have a 3.0-stable kernel with patches that were not in a released
3.x.0 kernel. Besides, they were very low priority. I forgot to update
the changelog to match.

Thanks for reviewing them in detail and getting the flaws corrected.
I expect it'll be a bit more smooth if/when I do something like this again.
