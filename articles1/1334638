Hmm, interesting. Thanks for sharing this. I personally never saw this
bug kicking in, but if I understand your findings correctly, we would
need something like the following patch for snd-usb and the storage dri=
ver?

Sarbojit, could you give this a test and see whether your kernel still
crashes in any of the two drivers?
