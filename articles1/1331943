In that case, I'll just keep tcm_vhost in drivers/vhost/ for now and
await MST's return to determine if he's willing to ACK this round (via
target-pending) for an initial merge.

I'd like to try to avoid slipping to v3.7 if possible, as we'll have the
necessary dependencies in mainline over the next days once net-next is
merged.  It's also self-contained driver that does not effect existing
code (aside from what's already been ACK'ed), so risk is very low..
