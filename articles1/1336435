I don't think the mini-DP port works at all with the integrated
graphics, at least not on a Macbook Pro 8,2. I played around with it
yesterday under OS X. When using the DGPU with an external monitor it
works fine, but any attempts to switch to the IGPU were rejected by the
drivers. If I forced it to the IGPU prior to connecting the external
monitor the screen just remained blank when I plugged it in, until I
switched back to the DGPU. It's odd though that the DDC can be switched
over to the IGPU.

Iirc you've got the 8,3, and I'd expect it to be identical to the 8,2 in
this respect. Also, the only reason my LVDS didn't work was because I
wasn't telling i915 to disable SSC. I've got a patch to add a quirk for
this that I'll send soon, since there still doesn't seem to be any way
to get the vbios for the Intel graphics.
