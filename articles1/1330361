Any reply is good. Thanks for taking the time. Thanks as well for
correcting Ken Chen's email address as I had no idea where he was any
more :)

I read through some of the old mails and there were a lot of revisions that
caught a wide variety of problems. It looked exhausting and I can see how
this one might have been missed.  Even when I had a test case demonstrating
the problem, it took me a long time to spot exactly where we might be racing.

Yes - or at least the test case was able to run for 2 hours without
triggering the bug when normally it would trigger in under 3 minutes.

My concern with the trylock thing actually was that in theory it could
retry forever. If Peter happens to read this patch his "unbounded latency"
detector is going to tut at me. I wondered if it would be better to just
fail sharing in the contended case but I expected that it would only need
to retry for a very short period of time for any real workload.

My main concern is that I might be papering over the problem and I have
the wrong race. One impact of this patch is that holding mmap_sem of the
remote process prevents shmdt running in parallel as it takes mmap_sem
for write so the fix may be coincidental even if it is effective.

I'll take the risk for you: you almost certainly mean clearing the PUD entry.

I'm relieved that you thought along these lines as well. I also considered
the possibility of clearing the PUD entry on unsharing and doing the freeing
there. I abandoned the approach early on  because I concluded there would
be a few problems with it.

1. When sharing, it is obvious if there are other users of the shared
   page table - elevated page count on the PTE. For the last user of the
   shared page table, it is not known if we shared in the past. In itself
   this is not a major problem but it does mean that huge_pmd_unshare
   would always have to tear down page tables below the PUD level

2. It means duplicating some logic of free_pgtables() and moving it into
   arch-specific code or into mm/hugetlb.c. I did not want to move any
   details related to mmu_gather into a rarely used path

3. Pagetable teardown and free of hugetlbfs pages on x86 would be
   different to every other arch. x86 and hugetlbfs is already different
   to other architectures but I did not want to compound this problem more
   than necessary

4. If I'm right about the race conditions then a parallel process running
   free_pgtables() could conceivably be operating on the same area at the
   same time because it is holding the wrong mm->page_table_lock. They
   are both freeing so may not be a problem but it felt wrong.

5. In general, I felt this would be significantly more complex than my
   heavy-handed approach unless I missed an obvious way of implementing
   it which is always possible :)

> If nothing but x86 uses sharing at this level (again I've not checked)

AFAIK, only x86 shares like this.

It's a risk albeit it a small one.

I think it would have to be a VMA flag because that's what
page_table_shareable() is using. I don't think I can use a new VMA flag
for a user case like pagetable sharing but I could use an "impossible"
flag.

I'm not keen on the idea of doing the page table teardown and free on or
near huge_pmd_unshare because I think it'll be more complex. Abusing VMA
flags might work but there is a problem that the VMA flag might "leak".
If we are truncating for example, we call unmap_hugepage_range and if
that thing sets a VMA flag it might persist to trip on some BUG check
later or introduce weird race conditions depending on what flag was
abused (e.g. abusing VM_GROWSDOWN might introduce a weird race with
fault)

I could set the impossible flag in unmap_vmas() but then it is moving a
hack necessary for arch-specific code to the core MM. Would that be ok
or is it just ugly?

Yes, I was cut&pasting a bit here.
