thanks for your explanation.
So, is it correct to say that any patch contained within l2-mtd (but 
*NOT* within linux-mtd) will eventually be killed? (Or rather, 
*replaced* by the version eventually applied to linux-mtd)?
In other words, when you say "Artem updates his tree", it is technically 
a rebase (so his version of a patch actually looks as if never existed), 
right?

Thanks a lot!
Gerlando
