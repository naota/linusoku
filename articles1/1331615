A controller can have the MMC_CAP_8_BIT_DATA capability but the board
will decide the bus-width. The bus-width is specified in the dts files
of each board (or platform data). The bus-width for data transfer is
then decided by the MMC core code based on the caps and the bus-width
information. So MMC_CAP_8_BIT_DATA can be specified irrespective   of
whether the board supports 8-bit or not.

The caps listed in exynos5250_dwmmc_caps is applicable only for
Exynos5 SoC's. Could you please let me know if there is anything
incorrect here.

The tests have only been completed on Exynos5250. I do not have boards
for other Samsung SoC's which have a dw_mmc port connected and used on
the board. When we have other platforms tested with this patchset, we
can extend the 'if' check in the above code for other SoC's.

Yes, with the correct checks for the type of SoC, differences in the
usage of 0x9C register can be handled.

Ok. I will relook at these patches and check if we really need split
these changes into a separate exynos specific file. If I again feel
that such a split is not required, I will reply back to you with
justification.

Non-Samsung platforms will not have this property in their dts files.
This property is required on only those platforms that want to define
sdr and ddr timing values. It is not required on platforms that do no
use it.

Yes, sorry, missed this last time. These are default values for SDR
and DDR timing in case it is not specified in dts file. It may be
better to make it mandatory to specify the SDR and DDR property in dts
files (for Exynos5250) and remove this default values. Non-samsung
platforms or platforms not using this property are unaffected by this.
