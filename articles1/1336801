Long story short -- I was debugging a problem where 'setarch --uname-2.6' 
would not work on s390 on (older) 3.x kernel. Turned out to be a 
corruption of top bytes of personality across exec() on s390.

I was doing quite some over-the-tree grepping during this, and found out 
that at least parisc, powerpc and sparc64 (davem already queued my patch 
for this) would under some silently ignore discard the top bytes of 
personality flags passed to sys_personality().

In case of parsic, let's take a process with current->personality == 
PER_LINUX32 callling personality(PER_LINUX | UNAME26). The

        if (personality(current->personality) == PER_LINUX32
            && personality == PER_LINUX)
                personality = PER_LINUX32;

would that have no effect, and sys_personality() would be called with 
(PER_LINUX | UNAME26) instead of PER_LINUX32, just because of UNAME26 
being set as well. That doesn't seem really correct. Is it?
