=46urther patches are welcome ;) It's not a trivial difference though.
The "horizontal bar" is not a curses concept, it's implemented via the
menubox lxdialog whereas search results are currently presented via a
textbox lxdialog.

In that case there's nowhere to jump to. That's why those symbols don't
get a number.
