If you store the size as a precomputed bitmask, that should simplify the
bucket lookup to just a fetch, mask, and offset.  (You shouldn't ever
need the actual number of buckets or the shift except when resizing, so
the bitmask seems like the optimal thing to store.)  With a fixed table
size, I'd expect to see the same code minus the fetch, with an immediate
in the masking instruction.  Did GCC's generated code have worse
differences than an immediate versus a fetched value?

Agreed.

I don't think any of this argues against having a second-level cache,
though, and making that one resizable seems sensible.  So, having a
scalable resizable hash table seems orthogonal to having a small
fixed-size hash table as a first-level cache.  I already agree with you
that the hash table API should not make the latter more complex or
expensive to better suit the former; as far as I can tell, address
generation seems like the only issue there.
