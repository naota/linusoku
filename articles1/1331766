commit fe4b1b244bdb96136855f2c694071cb09d140766 upstream.

Stable note: Not tracked on Bugzilla. THP and compaction was found to
	aggressively reclaim pages and stall systems under different
	situations that was addressed piecemeal over time. This patch
	addresses a problem where the fix regressed THP allocation
	success rates.

In commit [e0887c19: vmscan: limit direct reclaim for higher order
allocations], Rik noted that reclaim was too aggressive when THP was
enabled. In his initial patch he used the number of free pages to
decide if reclaim should abort for compaction. My feedback was that
reclaim and compaction should be using the same logic when deciding if
reclaim should be aborted.

Unfortunately, this had the effect of reducing THP success rates when
the workload included something like streaming reads that continually
allocated pages. The window during which compaction could run and return
a THP was too small.

This patch combines Rik's two patches together. compaction_suitable()
is still used to decide if reclaim should be aborted to allow
compaction is used. However, it will also ensure that there is a
reasonable buffer of free pages available. This improves upon the
THP allocation success rates but bounds the number of pages that are
freed for compaction.
