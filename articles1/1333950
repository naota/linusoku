Yeah that's a tough one. I wouldn't exactly call it a bug. There's 
probably lots of stuff like this you could do that the command line 
would allow you to perform but not be a correct and intended function. I 
would put this down to user error rather than a bug. Anyone with 
knowledge of operating systems and file system structuring should know 
that / or \ are illegal characters for creating a directories. Whether 
it be on Windows or Linux.
