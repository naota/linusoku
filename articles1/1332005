Configuration:	global-dhp__io-dbench4-async-ext4
Result: 	http://www.csn.ul.ie/~mel/postings/mmtests-20120424/global-dhp__io-dbench4-async-ext4
Benchmarks:	dbench4

Summary
=======

Nothing majorly exciting although throughput has been declining
slightly in a number of cases. However, this is not consistent
between machines and latency has also been variable. Broadly
speaking, there is not need to take any action here.

Benchmark notes
===============

mkfs was run on system startup. No attempt was made to age it. No
special mkfs or mount options were used.

dbench 4 was used. Tests ran for 180 seconds once warmed up. A varying
number of clients were used up to 64*NR_CPU. osync, sync-directory and
fsync were all off.

===========================================================
Machine:	arnold
Result:		http://www.csn.ul.ie/~mel/postings/mmtests-20120424/global-dhp__io-dbench4-async-ext4/arnold/comparison.html
Arch:		x86
CPUs:		1 socket, 2 threads
Model:		Pentium 4
Disk:		Single Rotary Disk
===========================================================

dbench4
-------

  In very vague terms, throughput has been getting worse over time but
  it's very gradual. Latency has also been getting worse.

==========================================================
Machine:	hydra
Result:		http://www.csn.ul.ie/~mel/postings/mmtests-20120424/global-dhp__io-dbench4-async-ext4/hydra/comparison.html
Arch:		x86-64
CPUs:		1 socket, 4 threads
Model:		AMD Phenom II X4 940
Disk:		Single Rotary Disk
Status:		Ok
==========================================================

dbench4
-------

  This is a mixed bag, there are gains and losses and it's hard to draw
  any meaningful conclusion.

==========================================================
Machine:	sandy
Result:		http://www.csn.ul.ie/~mel/postings/mmtests-20120424/global-dhp__io-dbench4-async-ext4/sandy/comparison.html
Arch:		x86-64
CPUs:		1 socket, 8 threads
Model:		Intel Core i7-2600
Disk:		Single Rotary Disk
Status:		
==========================================================

dbench4
-------

  For the most part, there are few changes of note. Latency has
  been getting better particularly in 3.2 and later kernels.
