OK, thanks. Just to verify they actually had a "need" to specify GPL, I 
changed it to proprietary to see if they in fact were using GPL-only 
symbols. It compiled without complaint. As I've seen in the past, and one 
reason why our drivers are GPL, they won't even build if a GPL exported 
symbol is referenced. IE

   Building modules, stage 2.
   MODPOST 1 modules
FATAL: modpost: GPL-incompatible module somemod.ko uses GPL-only symbol 
'somesymbol'

This particular driver  does in fact build cleanly after changing the GPL 
to PROPRIETARY. I haven't actually purchased the product yet so am unable 
to load it, but can I assume that if I don't have a build issue when 
specifying PROPRIETARY, that they are in fact NOT using GPL symbols and 
maybe they just thought they needed to specify GPL for some reason or another?

Thanks
Mark
