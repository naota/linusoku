Hi Betty.

Wow, you're thorough.  Thanks for testing.

I don't mind that it doesn't work in all cases.
I suppose this would fail for loops too.

checkpatch is a pretty limited tool as it depends on
the code being compilable and doesn't really understand
c syntax.  It is just a convenience tool and lots of
its logic is incomplete and some of its output can be
happily ignored.

cheers, Joe
