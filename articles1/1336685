We have N_NORMAL_MEMORY for standing for the nodes that have normal memory with
zone_type <= ZONE_NORMAL.

And we have N_HIGH_MEMORY for standing for the nodes that have normal or high
memory.

But we don't have any word to stand for the nodes that have *any* memory.

And we have N_CPU but without N_MEMORY.

Current code reuse the N_HIGH_MEMORY for this purpose because any node which
has memory must have high memory or normal memory currently.

A)	But this reusing is bad for *readability*. Because the name
	N_HIGH_MEMORY just stands for high or normal:

A.example 1)
	mem_cgroup_nr_lru_pages():
		for_each_node_state(nid, N_HIGH_MEMORY)

	The user will be confused(why this function just counts for high or
	normal memory node? does it counts for ZONE_MOVABLE's lru pages?)
	until someone else tell them N_HIGH_MEMORY is reused to stand for
	nodes that have any memory.

A.cont) If we introduce N_MEMORY, we can reduce this confusing
	AND make the code more clearly:

A.example 2) mm/page_cgroup.c use N_HIGH_MEMORY twice:

	One is in page_cgroup_init(void):
		for_each_node_state(nid, N_HIGH_MEMORY) {

	It means if the node have memory, we will allocate page_cgroup map for
	the node. We should use N_MEMORY instead here to gaim more clearly.

	The second using is in alloc_page_cgroup():
		if (node_state(nid, N_HIGH_MEMORY))
			addr = vzalloc_node(size, nid);

	It means if the node has high or normal memory that can be allocated
	from kernel. We should keep N_HIGH_MEMORY here, and it will be better
	if the "any memory" semantic of N_HIGH_MEMORY is removed.

B)	This reusing is out-dated if we introduce MOVABLE-dedicated node.
	The MOVABLE-dedicated node should not appear in
	node_stats[N_HIGH_MEMORY] nor node_stats[N_NORMAL_MEMORY],
	because MOVABLE-dedicated node has no high or normal memory.

	In x86_64, N_HIGH_MEMORY=N_NORMAL_MEMORY, if a MOVABLE-dedicated node
	is in node_stats[N_HIGH_MEMORY], it is also means it is in
	node_stats[N_NORMAL_MEMORY], it causes SLUB wrong.

	The slub uses
		for_each_node_state(nid, N_NORMAL_MEMORY)
	and creates kmem_cache_node for MOVABLE-dedicated node and cause problem.

In one word, we need a N_MEMORY. We just intrude it as an alias to
N_HIGH_MEMORY and fix all im-proper usages of N_HIGH_MEMORY in late patches.
