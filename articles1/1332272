In this case it they were both there, but it picked up the branch
anyway. I actually made sure that the tag description was included
by git-request-pull, and the tag has a different name from the
branch (no "next/" prefix), but the tool is not does not attempt
to pick up the tag rather than the branch when both are available.

Apparently, the problem is that it treats the branch "next/foo"
as as exact match for a pull request on the "foo" tag even when
that tag is present as "foo" on the server. If I either name the
branch or the tag differently, or pass "tags/foo" as the
argument to git-request-pull, it reports back the tag instead.
