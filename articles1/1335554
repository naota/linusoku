Hi Simon,

I don't see any need for microseconds myself - anybody sees use for 
finer-grained delays?

Btw, I noticed I was using mdelay instead of msleep - caught and fixed that.

There is one reason, but it might be a bad one. On Tegra, PWM phandle 
uses an extra cell to encode the duty-cycle the PWM should have when we 
call get_pwm(). This makes it possible to address the same PWM with 
different phandles (and different duty cycles), which causes an issue to 
know whether a PWM is already used in a sequence (potentially resulting 
in multiple get_pwm calls on the same PWM, and also opens the door to 
ambiguities in behavior (what is the correct duty-cycle to use if 
several different values are passed?)

Maybe the problem lies in how PWM phandles are handled - if duty-cycle 
was not part of the information, we would not have this problem.

Same thing, enable/disable which would call pwm_enable and pwm_disable. 
One could also image an additional property to set the duty cycle if it 
can be taken off the phandle.

Yes, this definitely needs more documentation - especially the DT part.

Thanks,
Alex.
