I was not aware of that and it's not something I had noticed for any other
MM backports to -stable. I wanted to call it out instead of seeing if
reviewers happened to spot the upstream commit did not resemble this patch :)

If there is no problem with this then the note can change slightly

Stable note: Not tracked in Bugzilla. This is a partial backport of an
	upstream commit addressing a completely different issue
	that accidentally contained an important fix. The workload
	this patch helps was memcached when IO is started in the
	background. memcached should stay resident but without this patch
	it gets swapped. Sometimes this manifests as a drop in throughput
	but mostly it was observed through /proc/vmstat.
