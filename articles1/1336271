Yes and these select statements make sense, what you suggest though doesn't,
at least from my point of view. What you want is that you don't get
presented the option to select the PWM system if there no PWM driver
available based on your other config options. But whether a PWM driver is
available or not is not a issue of which arch you are building for.

You could do that by using a construct like below, but well...

config HAS_PWM
    bool

config PWM
    bool "PWM
    depends on HAS_PWM

config PWM_CAN_BUILD_DRIVER_X
    defbool I2C
    select HAS_PWM

config PWM_DRIVER_X
    tristate "PWM chip X support"
    depends on PWM && PWM_CAN_BUILD_DRIVER_X

config PWM_CAN_BUILD_DRIVER_Y
    defbool ARCH_Y
    select HAS_PWM

config PWM_DRIVER_Y
    tristate "PWM chip Y support"
    depends on PWM && PWM_CAN_BUILD_DRIVER_Y
