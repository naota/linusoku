Hi Len and Bjorn, 

is there anything that needs to be done in order for the patch series
to be included in either 3.6 or 3.7?  Except for the (viable) question
as to whether or not a sysfs interface should accept complex inputs
(as it currently does and which is not introduced by this patch series), 
there have been no comments since March, when I made some changes due 
to Bjorn's well made observations. 

The patches extend Linux's PNP capabilities and are required for some
hardware, like the IBM ThinkPad 600E (and similar machines). 

All other users of the ABI should not see any regressions (the ABI
stays the same).
