Sorry, I'm not familiar with per-cpu rw semaphores.  Where are they
implemented?

I wasn't suggesting that we leave the problem unfixed (though I can see
how you might have gotten that idea, sorry for not being more clear).  I
was merely suggesting that we should try to fix the problem in a way
that does not kill performance.
