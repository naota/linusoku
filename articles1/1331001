It's very similar to how it was with nouveau: we are not sure
we can commit to the userspace ABI yet.

Most importantly, it still seems not 100% clear whether this driver will
have major userspace using it. And if not, it would be very hard to
support a driver when recent userspace does not use it in the end.

At the moment arguments on upstream mailing list seem to be
a bit circular: there's no module in upstream kernel so
userspace does not want to accept the patches.

If we put enabling this driver in staging, then it works out in one of
two ways
- userspace starts using it then this effectively freezes the ABI and
  we move it out of staging next release
- no userspace uses it and we drop it completely or rework ABI

On the other hand, it is marginally better to not want code in staging
for two reasons:
- there are dependencies between this code and other code in
  drivers/vhost which are easier for me to handle if it's all
  in one place
- a bit easier to track history if we do not move code

What do you think?
