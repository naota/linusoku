Thanks.

Now that a nice patch seems to be available that takes care of
everything :), it seems like a good moment to make sure that the next
time there are scheduler changes people can easily see what they need
to do.

That is, what information would someone new to this code benefit from
in order to keep it working well?

I am particularly interested in making sure your tests don't get lost.
How about something like this?

Subject: sched: add skeleton load-avg documentation

For now this is just a link to
http://www.smythies.com/~doug/network/load_average/ which has some
useful examples of how to test changes.
