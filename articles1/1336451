Some progress

the fallocate bug is not the only bug
latest head with the fallocate correction still crash
( in read_blocks )

So i have restart bisection but at each stage i reinject the fallocate
patch ( is it a corerct way to do this ?)
Bisection is not very fast but for the moment (sometimes i need to rebo=
t
harsly and it kicks a rebuild of the raid array ) :

git bisect start

git bisect bad f5e7e844a571124ffc117d4696787d6afc4fc5ae

Each bad has failed with the read_block OOPS ( so somewhat consistent
for now )
