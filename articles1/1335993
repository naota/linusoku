I can't even *begin* to guess how something like that could happen due
to kernel issues.

The signals you see are TTY signals, but SIGINT/HUP really don't make
sense as a tty layer bug either. If it was *just* SIGHUP I'd think it
was some tty refcounting issue, but with different signals that sounds
very very unlikely.

Quite frankly, from those symptoms I'd suspect the terminal program
being confused over a kernel issue. Of course, it could be a kernel
change that in turn confuses a terminal program.
