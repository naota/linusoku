Ho-hum. I beg to disagree.

drivers/scsi/aacraid/aachba.c:2266

		/* Do not cache partition table for arrays */
		scsicmd->device->removable =3D 1;

To the extend of my knowledge aacraid does this _precisely_ to allow
for resizing; in effect every open() will trigger a device revalidation=
=2E

So I guess by just setting the 'removable' flag you should be okay.
You might need to remount it, but that's another story.
