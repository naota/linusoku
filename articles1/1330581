Thank you for letting my know your idea.

Let me explain my opinion.
If you are concerned about multiple OOPS case, I think an user app which logs from /dev/pstore to /var/log should be developed.
Once it is developed, we don't need to care about multiple oops case and the appropriate number is two.

- In case where system is workable after oops.
The user app will erase an entry in NVRAM.
And we can get the message via /var/log.

- In case where system hangs up or panics due to the oops.
Oops is the critical message and we don't need care about subsequent events.
 
What do you think?

You are right.
There is no user app above right now. So, I was in stuck...
But I understand I shouldn't have introduce efi_pstore_log_num.
