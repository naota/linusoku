Well, yes.  I was thinking it would be more like:

distro/Kconfig.fedora
	menuconfig FEDORA
	if FEDORA
	config FEDORA_16
	   select WHATEVER
	config FEDORA_17
	...

distro/Kconfig.debian
	menuconfig DEBIAN
	if DEBIAN
	config DEBIAN_X
	...

etc.

Not one giant distro file with a bunch of varying distros doing a bunch
of selects.  But in general, yes there would be options for each
supported distro release.

How is the above not telling the kernel what it needs?  I'm confused how
the location of such a file makes it's functionality and usefulness
differ...  Quite possible I missed what you meant originally, but it
sounds like we're talking about the same thing?

Also, I'm not very convinced the 99% are going to be wanting to install
shiny new versions of a distro with a kernel older than what the distro
ships with.  I could be very wrong, but it seems like in-general the
whole premise of this RFC was geared towards using new kernels on
distros.

kconfig already spits out warnings for symbols being selected that
don't exist.
