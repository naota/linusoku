I'm not convinced about that.  bsg requires a request_queue, and we
don't have one in the absence of any storage.  There doesn't even seem
to be a standard way of sending commands to SCSI hosts, let alone block
device controllers.

Maybe we should design such a mechanism, but maybe we shouldn't ... as we
find common things to do, we tend to move those to sysfs, not ioctls,
and the kinds of commands that are being sent here are essentially
vendor-specific NVMe commands; it's not clear they'd fit neatly into a
generic mechanism.
