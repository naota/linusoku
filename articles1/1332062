Ok, so I've merged some things a bit differently, but afaik it's all
semantically identical *except* for the merge of the file

  arch/arm/mach-omap2/clockdomains3xxx_data.c

in my merge of your "general arm-soc cleanups" pull request.

In your "for-linus" branch, "&mpu_3xxx_clkdm" remains in the
clockdomains_common[] array. In my merge, it is gone. But I think I
did the merge correctly, and you did it wrong. HOWEVER, I don't know
the code, maybe there is some subtle reason why you did it like you
did.

Your "for-linus" branch also had that

   arch/arm/arm-soc-for-next-contents.txt

file that shouldn't have been there, but whatever.

Anyway, apart from that "please check" comment, I also have small
complaint: your pull requests didn't actually point to the tags, they
pointed to the next/xyz commits. So every time I did a pull, I had to
change "next/xyz" to "tags/xyz". That's just annoying make-work. I
think it's because you just said "xyz" to the git request-pull script,
and then git had to pick one of the things and picked next. Please
disambiguate by just saying "tags/xyz" explicitly.
