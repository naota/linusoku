Thank you very much, it works with these parameters! Looks like viafb can wake 
up the chip from S3, only the colors are messed up (X<->VT switch fixes 
that).

Looking at openchrome and viafb code - the code is already present in viafb in 
fp_id_to_vindex() function in lcd.c. It even finds correct panel_id for me 
(3). But it looks like that the result is not used.
