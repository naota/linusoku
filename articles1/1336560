Yep, it's not fun, but the timer should only run on particular HP
systems.  The alternative is "dead" ports.  Alex, can you update your
description to include that fact?

Greg and I already argued about making the timer settable via a module
parameter, and I think the basic answer was that he doesn't want a new
modparam for this.

I would really rather the quirk addition and application to some machine
be in the same patch.  That's how the other quirk patches have been
applied in the past.
