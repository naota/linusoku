Nah, not odd places. Simply doing "wrmsr... " as root would suffice.

I'm fine with the "might not be a bad idea" thing. I'm saying that it
seems like a bad idea in certain cases...

Right and best it would be if *only* virtualization had access to those
MSRs and CPUID bits. IOW, you #GP when accessing them in the normal case
and access is granted when in VMRUN context.

Or rather, aim and squeeze :-)

Not much more harder using msr-tools and easily scriptable. See above.

That's easy: the first question we ask from the bug reporter is (and you
do that too, btw - I've seen you dozens of times :-)) "can you reproduce
it with mainline"?

> Does "bind mount your own cpuid file" cover this ?

Well, AFAICU, the writes to the MSRs are globally visible. If you're
asking whether through bind-mounting your own cpuid file we're making
the process of toggling CPUID bits more involved versus using simply
kernel command line options then this is probably a step in the right
direction IMHO, BUT (!)...

... there's still a software-only solution needed for CPUID leafs which
cannot be toggled through MSR writes simply because there are no such
MSRs.

The solution to that situation could cover all issues without touching
the kernel.
