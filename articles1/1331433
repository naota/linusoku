On modern systems, the OS goes by whatever is in the ACPI table
describing the PCI bus.  In QEMU, we have:

    WordIO (ResourceProducer, MinFixed, MaxFixed, PosDecode, EntireRange,
          0x0000,             // Address Space Granularity
          0x0D00,             // Address Range Minimum
          0xFFFF,             // Address Range Maximum
          0x0000,             // Address Translation Offset
          0xF300,             // Address Length
          ,, , TypeStatic)

So Linux will always use 0x0D00 -> 0xFFFF for the valid
range. Practically speaking, you can't use anything below 0x0D00 because
the PCI bus configuration registers live at 0xCF8-0xCFF.  If you tried
to create the region starting at 0x0500 you'd have to limit it to 0xCF8
to avoid conflicting with the PCI host controller.

That's not a useful amount of space for I/O ports so that would be a
pretty dumb thing to do.

I think you're confusing PIO with MMIO.  They are separate address
spaces.

You could certainly argue that relying on PIO is way too architecture
specific since that's only available on x86.  That's a good argument but
the counter is that other architectures have their own interfaces for
this sort of thing.

I agree with the above.
