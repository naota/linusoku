Ok, finally I found some time. In general, the patch works fine. The
only detail I had to amend was the irqflags, which were changed from
IRQF_TRIGGER_RISING/IRQF_TRIGGER_FALLING to
IRQF_TRIGGER_HIGH/IRQF_TRIGGER_LOW, which doesn't work as the PXA can't
deal with level-based IRQs. Changing this back to RISING/FALLING makes
the driver work again.

With that correction, feel free to add my Acked-by:/Tested-by:

Thanks and sorry again for the slow response.

Daniel
