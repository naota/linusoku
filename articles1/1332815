It may be a long time and wouldn't help with early bugs.

I haven't seen this yet.

Any of the two above would be fine.

That's what I currently have (though not included in this post) but I
don't particularly the approach. There are advantages in being able to
call printascii from assembly early on but if we don't have a standard
UART than it goes against single Image file.

My proposal is to allow DCC very early on for development kernels
(possibly called from assembly) with a timeout if there is no JTAG
connection. Immediately after setup_machine_fdt() switch to a UART early
console if there is one. But we retrieve this information from the FDT.

I would say the early_printk console should not bother with UART
initialisation (done by the boot loader) but just the actual character
sending. It should also be placed somewhere under drivers/ as it may
be shared by other architectures (it's just specific to the UART chip).
