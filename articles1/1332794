This was a mistake in my workflow that needs a bit of ironing out.

The mistake is that I took the patch from the distribution kernel which was
merged at a time before the coding style fixes were applied. The upstream
commit and signed-off lines were "fixed" but I failed to refresh the
patch and missed that it differed from upstream. Thanks for catching this.
I'll adjust my workflow and assistant scripts to watch for this sort of
problem in the future.

Correct but due to a mistake, not for any good reason.

I hope it didn't.

Thanks Greg.
