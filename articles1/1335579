So basically the first range being 4k exist because MTRRs might define ra=
nges
there and those are always aligned to 4k but not necessarily to the bigge=
r pages
used. Reading through the Intel and AMD docs indicates various levels of =
badness
when this is not the case. Though afaict MTRRs are not tied to long mode =
capable
CPUs. For example Atom is 32bit only (the earlier ones at least) and uses=
 MTRRs.
So testing for LM would miss those.
Would it not be better to unconditionally have the first 2/4M as 4k pages=
? At
least as long as there is no check for the alignment of the MTRR ranges. =
Or
thinking of it, the runtime test should look for X86_FEATURE_MTRR, should=
n't it?
