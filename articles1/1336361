The IOAPIC knows how many sources are available and this number should
be used instead of 32.
This won't solve the problem with get_irq_data() for the second ioapic
which might be available in the system.

The reason why there is no irq_data() available is that this is
allocated by io_apic_setup_irq_pin_once() which is now called too late. 
Usually a PCI device does a pci_enable() call and then we do all this.
So to keep the function happy you should preallocate all interrupts
which are offered. Ah, and you may need a map function which does
nothing because the programming is done at io_apic_setup_irq_pin_once()
time.
Maybe you could live with irq_domain_add_linear() instead. Not sure how
important it is to keep rtc at a fixed irq. I think as far as the
IOAPIC is concerned, it could be programmed to another number but I
kept it in sync. However parts of the ioapic code rely on gsi_number ==
irq number so maybe we should preallocate the irq_data and use a dummy
map() function for the start.

There is an option which delays each printk by a few msecs. Maybe this
could help.
