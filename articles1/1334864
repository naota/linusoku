I consider this approach a half-way step.  Quick attempts on my laptop
and I couldn't find a case where the bio path was a loss, but in theory
if the host wasn't doing any reordering and it was a slow device, you'd
want the guest to do so.

I'm not sure if current qemu can be configured to do such a thing?

Cheers,
Rusty.
