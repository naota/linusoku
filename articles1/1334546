delayed_work has been annoyingly missing the mechanism to modify timer
of a pending delayed_work - ie. mod_timer() counterpart.  delayed_work
users have been working around this using several methods - using an
explicit timer + work item, messing directly with delayed_work->timer,
and canceling before re-queueing, all of which are error-prone and/or
ugly.

Gustavo Padovan posted a RFC implementation[1] of mod_delayed_work() a
while back but it wasn't complete.  To properly implement
mod_delayed_work[_on](), it should be able to steal pending work items
which may be on timer or worklist or anywhere inbetween.  This is
similar to what __cancel_work_timer() does but it turns out that there
are a lot of holes around this area and try_to_grab_pending() needs
considerable amount of work to be used for other purposes too.

This patchset improves canceling and try_to_grab_pending(), use it to
implement mod_delayed_work[_on](), convert easy ones, and drop
__cancel_delayed_work_sync() which doesn't have relevant users
afterwards.

 0014-workqueue-use-mod_delayed_work-instead-of-cancel-que.patch
 0015-workqueue-deprecate-__cancel_delayed_work.patch

0001-0003 are preparatory.

0004 removes the possibility of cancel_sync spinning for extended
period of time while another task holding PENDING is preempted.

0005-0007 clean up local queueing handling.

0008-0011 prepare for try_to_grab_pending() improvements.

0012 makes try_to_grab_pending() distinguish transient failure which
can be safely busy-retried and failure because the work item is being
canceled, which may take arbitrary amount of time.

0013 uses the improve try_to_grab_pending() to implement
mod_delayed_work[_on]().

0014 converts cancel + queue sequences to mod_delayed_work().

0015 drops __cancel_delayed_work() which doesn't have any relevant
user left.  Not all conversions are trivial.  If you're involved with
edac, thinkpad_acpi, charger-manager, thermal_sys or nic link_watch,
please take a look at the conversion made in 0015.

This patchset is also available at the following git branch.

 git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/tj/wq.git review-wq-mod_delayed

If nobody objects, I'd like to route this series through wq/for-3.7.
Changes to other subsystems are fairly localized and conflicts, if
they occur, shouldn't be too painful to handle.

Although this ends up adding ~90 LOC, it contains a lot more
documentation, converted only the apparent ones, and IMHO is
worthwhile to have regardless as it removes an annoyance which is
pretty easy to encounter while using delayed_work.

Thanks.
