Yes, I think you are right now that I look at it again. Paul Walmsley
can have another look at the merge and send an update if we are both
missing something now.

That's the file I use for communication with Olof about stuff we
merge. I briefly considered rebuilding a branch for your reference
without it, but since you always do the merges yourself I figured there
would be no need.
We do leave this file in the for-next branch because it helps some
people sending us patches to see what the existing branches and
interdependencies are.

I spent too much time fiddling with my scripts again in an attempt to
get closer to the regular git-request-pull version. The older version
got this right, but unfortunately I removed the part where I manually
print the right pull address because that had caused other problems
before.
I did the trivial fix you suggested now.
