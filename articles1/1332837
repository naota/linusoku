+ Jens Axboe

Hi Jens,
Can you please review the v8 patch and refer to it? As seen below,
everything is all set to push the change in the mmc layer,
But it's better to push the feature to both modules

Hi Chris,
I just uploaded a v8, which has small fix in the block layer. It has no
changes at all, in the mmc layer.
Hope we soon have a reply from Jens regarding when the sanitize patch can be
pushed in to linux-next in the block layer.


Thanks,
Yaniv
