But virtio-scsi does, LUN "16384" and LUN 0 are the same.

If somebody wanted to add support for >16383 LUNs, we would do it with
the 4-byte encoding that is in SAM, but I don't see that happening.

Hardware that knows about format=1 LUNs, and yet treats LUN 0
differently depending on the encoding sounds buggy.

Of course some hardware may not know anything about format=1, so it is
wrong to pass format=1 unconditionally, but virtio-scsi does.
