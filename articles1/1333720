Okay, so your suggestion is to strip out all of the sub-devices under=20
the AB8500. It's doable, but will take some restructuring and thinking=20
about. This is a job for another day. I think it's okay to continue wit=
h=20
the current semantics for the time-being. The line we're discussing doe=
s=20
need to be split out though. I didn't mean to merge it in with the ASoC=
=20
stuff.
