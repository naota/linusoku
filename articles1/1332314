June has been a pretty slow month for XFS in Linus tree, as June saw the
stabilization of the Linux 3.5 and thus only a handful of important XFS
fixes.  Development of the tree destined for the next merge window has been
a bit more busy with the addition of discontinuous buffers that replace the
dabuf layer which has performance issues and isn't easy to deal with in the
upcoming metadata checksumming as well as a few smaller cleanups.

The list saw various other patches not applied yet, most notable a
refactoring and speedup of the inode allocator, and a heavily discussed
rewrite of the mount option parsing.

On the user space side a small number of fixes to the handling of fragmented
directories were applied to xfs_repair, and xfstests saw a fix for handling
different versions of xfsdump.
