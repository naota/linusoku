Don't be sorry at all as your reasoning is solid. I'm not leaving the patch
in because I think you're wrong. I feel it is preferable to minimise the
deviation of upstream patches as much as possible but stable reviewers may
prefer to minimise functional change. We'll see where the consensus lies
if I leave the patch in but learn nothing if I take it out at this point.
