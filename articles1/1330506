It's understandable that you might not want to risk corrupting an
important filesystem.  Some systems allow you to run with a read-only
root and no swap; you could try that.  Or run entirely from within an
initramfs image, the way a Rescue CD does.

Running within an initramfs image would probably avoid this problem.

That's one of the reasons why reproducing the problem is important.

Not recently, I hope!

What you described does sound very weird.  The relation between block 
devices and the underlying physical devices is determined entirely by 
software data structures, which should not change over the course of a 
suspend.  I don't understand how it could have happened.
