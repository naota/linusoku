What is actually preventing ARCH_HAS_SG_CHAIN from all these ARCHES?
is that the DMA drivers not using for_each_sg(). Sounds like easy
to fix.

But yes a deep change would convert ARCH_HAS_SG_CHAIN to a Kconfig.

If you want to be lazy, like me, You might just put a BUILD_BUG_ON
in code, requesting the user to disable the driver for this ARCH.

I bet there is more things to do at ARCH to enable virtualization
then just support ARCH_HAS_SG_CHAIN. Be it just another requirement.

If you Document it and make sure current ARCHs are fine, it should
not ever trigger.

I believe they are the same, specially for the
on the stack 2 elements array. Actually I think
In both cases you need to at least call sg_init_table()
once after allocation, No?

Your old code with big array copy and re-shaping was
a better example of the need for your new API. Which I agree.

But please for my sake do not call it __sg_chain. Call it
something like sg_chain_not_end(). I hate those "__" which
for god sack means what? 
(A good name is when I don't have to read the code, an "__"
 means "fuck you go read the code")
