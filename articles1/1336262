Fair enough :)

Actually that's also used by libata-core (not in lxr yet) and dma-mapping:

http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/drivers/base/dma-mapping.c#L193

actually, res should point at the end of some internal devres structure,
and is only used as return value in this case.

Of course, in this case the release function can only use the struct
device pointer.

I've run some fail test and ftraced the whole thing and it seems to work
pretty good!  I'll send a v5 with the rename later.

Thanks,
Fabio
