After chatting with MST off-list he asked for a RFC-v4 series with one
extra change to vhost.h wrt the vhost-scsi ioctl defs.  He also said he
is OK with taking the first three patches -v4 through vhost.git and
letting staging take tcm_vhost.   Of course we'd need staging to depend
on vhost for that to work <cough> (compile) properly..  ;)

I'd like to re-spin -v4 this evening so that he can review + ACK the
full series before leaving for holiday tomorrow, so please let me know
what you'd prefer to do here.

So that said, do you prefer having tcm_vhost moved into drivers/staging
for -v4, or should we just be using a CONFIG_STAGING tag in
drivers/vhost/ and be done with it..?

Thank you!
