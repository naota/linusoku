Then you are in trouble :)

If there are going to be lots of dependancies, then I don't want it in
drivers/staging/ as it doesn't belong there, it belongs cleaned up and
in the "real" place.

git preserves this, don't worry about that at all.

So, if this code really does depend on core vhost changes that are going
to be happening over time, I would not recommend it being in
drivers/staging/ as you are right, you are going to have a hard time
syncing with me.

But don't think that by somehow marking the driver with CONFIG_STAGING
that you get a free pass on the "we are going to break the userspace
api", that's not ok.  Be careful about this.  Yes, it's tough, and it's
a "chicken and egg" problem like you mention above, I know.

sorry,
