Thanks for the good news!

The answer is clear here ;) Mel did the hard work of identifying the
culprit so kudos go to him.
I just tried to solve the issue more inside x86 arch code. The pmd
allocation outside of sharing code seemed strange to me for quite some
time I just underestimated its consequences completely.

Both approaches have some pros. Mel's patch is more resistant to other
not-yet-discovered races and it also makes the arch independent code
more robust because relying on the pmd trick is not ideal.
On the other hand, mine is more coupled with the sharing code so it
makes the code easier to follow and also makes the sharing more
effective because racing processes see pmd populated when checking for
shareable mappings.

So I am more inclined to mine but I don't want to push it because both
are good and make sense. What other people think?
