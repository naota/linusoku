Ian,

I think we could rip the PCI search stuff out of the comedi pci drivers
but I would like your opinion first.

1) Implement the "attach_pci" callback in all the pci drivers.
2) Change the "attach" callback to just return -EPERM, -EINVAL, or
    whatever seems appropriate. This has the most minimal effect
    on the comedi core. We could also just remove the "attach" from
    the pci drivers that have the "attach_pci" callback but the core
    would need some changes to account for this.

The COMEDI_DEVCONFIG ioctl, which is only used by the comedi_config
utility, would then fail on all the pci drivers but that should not be an
issue because the auto config stuff would still work correctly when the
module is loaded. You would lose the ability to specify the devnode
that the module is bound to but I think the sysfs "bind" and "unbind"
files are meant to handle that.

I think there are a couple pci drivers that would still need the old "attach"
in order to load firmware using comedi_config. We can address those
later and possibly figure out a more "standard" way to load the firmware.

What do you think?

Regards,
Hartley
