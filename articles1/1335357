Hi Amit,

Sorry for the late reply.

I'll check the mails.

Thanks. I'll check those patches.

I understood. We suggested vhost-serial as one of the ideas for
improving performances. Other features(trace-cmd, 9pfs, and
non-blocking chardev) should be supported first, I think.

It is the best that we can parse the data on a remote host in this
tracing system. Existing trace-cmd can already parse it on a remote
site. If we add the feature collecting event-format data(guest's
debugfs has that) from guests, we can parse tracing data on a remote
host as well as on a host running guests.

Thank you,
