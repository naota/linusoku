Also coming from a 'very small distro' position; I had this problem a few months
ago... my solution was this:

https://github.com/lbt/mer-kernel-check/blob/master/mer_verify_kernel_config#L127

So I'd appreciate something very much along the lines of what various low-level
services need and why since that way we can share work between distros and
package maintainers and offer this kind of ability to our users too.
