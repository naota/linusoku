I don't see the benefit of having the driver in staging.  Any vendors
who would notice the ntb driver in staging would be sitting on these
mailing lists and hopefully have planety of comments on the design.
Stashing the driver in staging while waiting for these comments (which
may never come) doesn't seem the best course of action.
