That's a reasonable question and thanks for taking a look at this series.

You're right, it doesn't. There are a few patches in this series that
were applied because they made other patches easier to apply and this is
one of them.  I should have noted this properly. Unlike other patches of
this type in the series, this particular one would have been easy to work
around. How about this as an updated note or would you prefer it was
dropped entirely?

Stable note: This patch makes later patches easier to apply but otherwise
	has little to justify it. It is a diagnostic patch that was part
	of a series addressing excessive slab shrinking after GFP_NOFS
	failures. There is detailed information on the series' motivation
	at https://lkml.org/lkml/2011/6/2/42 .
