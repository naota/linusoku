I know at least one re-branded same hardware by 3M, i will be able to borrow
one in a month or so. According to the wikipedia article, there's probably more.

There's also newer models and embeded ones in some video projector setup, also
re-branded, based on the same technology and that might use the same type of
protocol, but i can't be sure until someone can inspect them.
These pieces of hardware are quite expensive, and mostly used in educational
or corporate, they are not easy to grab.

The code structure (device selector + functions indirection) also seems overkill
to me for now, but permit to anticipate device's variations. If it appears that they
all works in the same way, it'll be easy (and more comfortable to me) to step down,
the opposite seems more difficult.

Cinder, cleaned.

I test the module against my running kernel, building out of tree,
and don't know how to define that in the makefile.
This will be cleaned in final step.

Part of "overkill" foresight.

ditto.
