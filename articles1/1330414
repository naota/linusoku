Do you mean "suspend" or "hibernate"?

That shouldn't happen in any case, but it seems more likely to happen 
after hibernation than after suspend.

Can you reproduce the problem?

Well, the dmesg log would help.  If you still think the USB layer is at 
fault then you should enable CONFIG_USB_DEBUG.

You don't have any good evidence to suggest that.  None of the
information you provided indicates that any USB device nodes (such as
/dev/bus/usb/001/002) got mixed up.  All you know is that the
block-layer device nodes (such as /dev/sda2) got changed.

Furthermore, if USB persist were broken then the symptoms would be 
different.  Instead of starting with a root partition at sdb1 and then 
finding it at sda1, you would have found it gone completely and there 
would be _new_ devices labelled sdc and sdd.
