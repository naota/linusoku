Not providing the userspace driver with enough information to give
users the best experience possible sounds horrid to me.  It turns out
that using a bounding box with fixed "[(min_x, min_y), (max_x,
max_y)]", and no per-finger pressure information, instead of the
coordinates and pressures provided by the firmware, is throwing away
useful data that could be used by the userspace driver.

What we would like is a way to tell userspace what the firmware
originally intended, but with a caveat that the firmware can't be 100%
trusted.  And, since this is for a relatively small class of hardware,
to do it in a way that doesn't consume precious resources, like
additional input properties.

This is essentially what this patch does.  It sets the SEMI_MT flag to
indicate that the kernel data cannot be totally trusted, and then
provides real MT-B (including per-finger pressures), instead of a
fixed bounding box.  It leaves it to userspace to treat the two slots
worth of coordinates as a bounding box or as actual fingers using its
own heuristics.  By limiting to only one hardware type (using DMI),
any breakage caused by this alternative use of the SEMI_MT flag is
limited.

Hopefully it is clear what we are trying to accomplish.  I don't see
how we can make a bounding box, even an improved bounding box, work.
Perhaps Henrik has a really good idea, but I haven't been able to
figure out what he is suggesting.

Thank you for the nice discussion and alternative suggestions about
better ways of doing this!
