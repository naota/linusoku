Hi Cyril,

Thanks for this, certainly looks like an interesting platform!

Of course, in order to perform any sort of sensible review, I'll need some
silicon to test it on :)

How many A15s can you have on such a SoC? It wasn't clear whether it was 1x4
or 4x4 from the documentation.

I assume you have *some* memory in the bottom 32-bits though, right? Even if
it's just a partial alias of a higher bank.

This is marked as `TI confidential' but I guess that's an oversight [or will
you have to kill me?].
