I think it's still needed for some of the devices that require external
firmware. The comedi_config utility allows the user to remove the
driver binding and then reattach to it while passing the firmware blob
into the driver.

Not saying any of this is valid... And yes, there probably is a more
"standard" way to do this. I just need a hint of what that is... ;-)

Ian Abbott is probably the best source to answer that.

I lot of the ISA drivers actually work for PC/104 variations of the boards. I
think they are still used somewhat. But yes, the pure ISA cards probably
are not very common. It's almost impossible to actually find a PC that has
ISA slots.
