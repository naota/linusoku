If msr-tools are used for cpuid masking, we will either get 
inconsistency between /proc/cpuinfo:flags and the output of the cpuid 
instruction or have to "synchronize" the clearcpuid boot option and the 
userspace app using msr-tools, which seems to be inconvenient. So, IMO, 
it would be better to have such functionality implemented in the kernel.
