We have:

1) Virtio--this is our preferred PV interface.  It needs PCI to be fully
initialized and probably will live as a module.

2) Hypercalls--this a secondary PV interface but is available very
early.  It's terminated in kvm.ko which means it can only operate on
things that are logically part of the CPU and/or APIC complex.

This patch introduces a third interface which is available early like
hypercalls but not necessarily terminated in kvm.ko.  That means it can
have a broader scope in functionality than (2).

We could just as well use a hypercall and have multiple commands issued
to that hypercall as a convention and add a new exit type to KVM that
sent that specific hypercall to userspace for processing.

But a PIO operation already has this behavior and requires no changes to kvm.ko.

There isn't really an obvious discrete RNG that is widely supported.

It's not a watchdog--it's the opposite of a watchdog.

You know such a thing already exists in the kernel, right?  S390 has had
a hypercall like this for years.
