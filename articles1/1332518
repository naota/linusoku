In the sense that cheap devices don't always handle rewrites of the
same sector well.  Often this results in the entire erase block being
rewritten, causing bad performance and wear-out.  Many cheap devices
aren't real block devices.  They are barely good enough to support
=46AT and may die near-instantly with a different write pattern.
Blockconsole assumes utter crap as an underlying device.

The timer mainly ensures that, on a quiet system, those two lines of
output from half an hour ago actually make it to the device
eventually.  In the case of a crash, the panic notifier is supposed to
do the same for those messages you _really_ care about.

Last paragraph. ;)

That would only work if you have at least 26 bytes to pad.  Bunch of
spaces with a newline works for any value between 0 and 512.
