Right, but when called with GFP_KERNEL mask, it can sleep, right?

Not possible to sleep for a long time means the function still *can*
sleep... even for short time. For a certain definion of "short."

Why, simply fix the comment to adhere to what the function does. And
since it can sleep, maybe the easiest fix is to say simply that:
"function can sleep", right?
