We have (so far) been testing this on software simulators, and we have 
an earlier version of this code booting up on an FPGA based emulation 
platform.

This device has a single cluster of 4 A15s.

Yes, there is a boot time alias of the initial part of memory in the 
32-bit space.  But this alias is somewhat limited in capabilities, and 
therefore we do not intend to use it much beyond boot.

:-)  That is an oversight, I'm sure.
