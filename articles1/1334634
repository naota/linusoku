Actually, based on the recent usb_wwan experience, I'd say that two suc=
h
bugs isn't as unlikely as it may seem at first.  Even three if we add
the now fixed usb_wwan (or six, if we count the three drivers affected
by the usb_wwan bug).  There are probably even more.

The reason is this change:

 0998d0631 device-core: Ensure drvdata =3D NULL when no driver is bound


It will make bugs like this suddenly 100% reproducible.  But the bugs
*are* in the drivers, and may have been there for a long time.  The
drivers have been accessing drvdata after unbinding.  They just didn't
crash prior to that commit.

But the commit is correct, and a very much needed improvement if my
assumptions are correct.  The drivers need fixing and this just makes i=
t
evident.

You could of course do like me and bisect, but if you end up with commi=
t
0998d0631 then you haven't really learned more than confirming my guess=
