Sure, it will take me a little while because the machine is shared between
several users.

Let me ask, I only have the binary and dont know if its OK to distribute
so I dont know exactly what is going on.  I did some tracing and saw 
forking,
group exits, multi-threading, hufetlbfs file creation, mmap'ng munmap'ng &
deleting the hugetlbfs
files.

I think this is exactly what is happening.  I'll put more cave-man debugging
code in and let you know.
