Admit this is not a killer feature..

Most times virt guest can do better than a physical OS. In that sense, 
this is where virtualization shines (live migration, hotplug for any 
virtual resource including net/block/cpu/memory/..).

There are plenty of niche but worth while small features such as the 
virtio-trace series and other that allow the host/virt-mgmt to get more 
insight into the guest w/o a need to configure the guest.

In theory guest OOM can trigger a host memory hot plug action. Again, I 
don't see it as a key feature..

There is already a fully emulated watchdog device in qemu.
