Phew, I'm glad to hear that, thanks.

You had me worried there, I hadn't considered truncation or invalidation2
at all.

But actually, I don't think they do pose any problem for my patch.  They
would indeed if I were removing VM_MAYSHARE in __unmap_hugepage_range()
as you show above; but no, I'm removing it in unmap_hugepage_range().

That's only called by unmap_single_vma(): which is called via
unmap_vmas() by unmap_region() or exit_mmap() just before free_pgtables()
(the problem cases); or by madvise_dontneed() via zap_page_range(), which
as you note is disallowed on VM_HUGETLB; or by zap_page_range_single().

zap_page_range_single() is called by zap_vma_ptes(), which is only
allowed on VM_PFNMAP; or by unmap_mapping_range_vma(), which looked
like it was going to deadlock on i_mmap_mutex (with or without my
patch) until I realized that hugetlbfs has its own hugetlbfs_setattr()
and hugetlb_vmtruncate() which don't use unmap_mapping_range() at all.

invalidate_inode_pages2() (and _range()) do use unmap_mapping_range(),
but hugetlbfs doesn't support direct_IO, and otherwise I think they're
called by a filesystem directly on its own inodes, which hugetlbfs
does not.  Anyway, if there's a deadlock on i_mmap_mutex somewhere
in there, it's not introduced by the proposed patch.

So, unmap_hugepage_range() is only being called in the problem cases,
just before free_pgtables(), when unmapping a vma (with mmap_sem held),
or when exiting (when we have the last reference to mm): in each case,
the vma is on its way out, and VM_MAYSHARE no longer of interest to others.

I spent a while concerned that I'd overlooked the truncation case, before
realizing that it's not a problem: the issue comes when we free_pgtables(),
which truncation makes no attempt to do.

So, after a bout of anxiety, I think my &= ~VM_MAYSHARE remains good.
