I don't actually understand this statement.  LUNS < 256 may be encoded
either way (they should be encoded with address method=0 but they don't
have to be) if you address the array with the wrong method, it doesn't
have to give you your lun.  Therefore we have to map back to whatever
the array gave us.  Hence the 1:1 mapping.  You're proposing an
injective mapping, so you can't reliably reverse it; that's why we don't
do it that way in SCSI.

It's nothing to do with buggy hardware ... it's to do with having an
exact representation of the lun.
