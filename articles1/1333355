Sorry to jump in late, but it's been another busy dev cycle and I
haven't had the time to look at this series in detail.  But just so you
know that somebody cares, we're also interested in bindings that will be
useful on other SoCs for PM domains.

However, since OMAP powerdomain support pre-dates generic powerdomains ,
the "generic" power domains aren't quite generic enough get for OMAP,
and I haven't had the time to extend the generic code, we haven't yet
moved to generic powerdomains.

FWIW, we're already working on making ti,hwmods disappear.  That was a
temporary step to allow us to easily migrate to DT using our existing,
in-tree description of device IP blocks (hwmods.)

That being said, I'm not sure why ti,hwmods is being used as an example
for powerdomains.  hwmods describe the integration of SoC IP blocks
(base addr, IRQ, DMA channel etc., which are being moved to DT) as well
as a bunch of SoC specific PM register descriptions.  This stuff is
SoC-specific PM register layout, so being very SoC specific, it has the
'ti' prefix in the DT binding.

Anyways, I hope to have a closer look this week, and I know Benoit
Cousson (CC'd) has some ideas for DT bindings for power domains as well.
Unfortunately, he's out until next week.
