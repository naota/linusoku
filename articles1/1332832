Whereas, if we go for a generic binding and get it wrong (which is quite
likely, given the general lack of information on what the needs are), we'll
have a much bigger problem that _will_ affect everyone.

So, my opinion is to go for vendor-specific attributes of limited scope for now,
that will be relatively easy to deprecate in the future.
