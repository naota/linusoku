Ask a lawyer but I believe Nvidia has more sense than that both
politically and legally. They walk a very fine line as it is (and IMHO
the wrong side of it but one day I guess a court will figure out where
the line actually is).

You cannot combine GPL and non GPL code, and since you are aware of the
fact there is a problem then you are probably a knowing infringer, which
is not a good situation to be in (triple damages in the US). If the module
license tag says it is GPL then I would talk to your lawyer about
it - you might actually be able to argue that it is therefore GPL
but I'm not a lawyer and you *really* don't want to try that stunt without
advice!

Talk to the Free Software Conservancy and gpl-violations.org.

Beyond that have a detailed discussion with your lawyer on the licence,
on "knowing infringment" and in particular check your insurance as most
legal insurance won't cover you in such a situation. If you redistribute
such material you are likely to also be liable, which can be very
expensive.

All of this comes down to one thing - you need to ask a lawyer legal
questions. I think you can already answer the "what happens if you get
caught" political questions. Given that maybe you don't need to ask a
lawyer but just say no ?
