Hi Alexis,

Did you run the patch through checkpatch.pl before submitting it?

I think you will get a bunch of important and completely automatic
feedback when you do that. Please fix everything that the script
mentions.

This is a pretty awful workaround for a teeny tiny hardware error.
You're making systems wake up every two seconds. I don't want that on
my system. I think making the timer settable would be nice.

Also, the patch does more things than what you describe. It adds a
new quirk, and it adds checks to set said quirk for various different
laptop models. Each of those changes (add timer+quirk, and add checks
to set quirk for laptops) should rather be a separate commit.

Is this style consistent with the surrounding code? I would be
surprised. The kernel frequently uses the "early exits" concept.
Please try to embrace it, I think it makes for lovely readable code.

A quote from
http://www.cranked.me/2008/07/spartan-programming-real-man-way-to-do.html

--8<--
Spartan programming strives for simultaneous minimization of all of
the following measures of code complexity:

1. horizontal complexity, that is, the depth of nesting of control
   structures, just as the total line length.

..

8. conditionals, that is the number of if and multiple branch
   switch statements. 
-->8--

This may not be in http://kernel.org/doc/Documentation/CodingStyle
per se, but Chapter 7: Centralized exiting of functions touches on
the issue, includes an example, and I've found it used a lot in the
kernel code. It's a very good idea.

I'm surprised how this get hardcoded from a header file.

I for one would like it to be settable.


Thanks
