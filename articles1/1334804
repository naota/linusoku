This isn't really anything to do with regmap, it's about implementing
shared IRQ support for threaded interrupts.  This is generally useful
and shouldn't be tied to regmap, it's common enough for hardware
designers to want to use wired or interrupts and it's a limitation of
Linux that it can't cope currently.

If are were going to implement it in regmap we shouldn't be faffing
around setting up the virtual interrupts, we should just do the right
thing and call round all the chips without bouncing it through the IRQ
core.

This is conditional in the core regmap runtime PM support, it may be
actively harmful if the device doesn't need it.
