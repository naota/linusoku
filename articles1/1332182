I'm not a marketing person but I expect the performance figures they
really care about are between versions of the product which includes more
than the kernel. The are not going to be comparisons between the upstream
kernel and the distribution kernel so they'll still are able to produce
the drool-inducing figures. By backporting certain performance figures,
data from regression testing major kernel releases is more valuable to
the distribution vendor when considering a change of kernel version.

There is also the lag factor to consider. Distribution kernels will carry
fixes for the functional and performance regression fixes from the time
of discovery and supply temporary kernels to their users to minimise the
lifetime of a bug. It could be weeks if not months before the same fixes
bubble their way up to -stable. They might never bubble up if the developer
is pressed for time or the patch unsuitable for -stable for some reason.

None of that takes into account the fact that distribution kernels are
backed by quality support and developer teams that can diagnose and fix
a range of problems encountered in the field. This is true whether it is
an distribution that directly sells support as part of the software or
is a distribution with a lot of developers that are also contractors.
The same guarantees do not necessarily apply to upstream kernels where
support is conditional on getting the attention of the right people.

These backports are not going to destroy the value proposition of
distribution kernels :)
