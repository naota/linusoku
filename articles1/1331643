I know they should stay in linux-next for a while before asking Linus t=
o
pull them, but I did not expect them to go into linux-next immediately
when I submitted all the patches into my next branch and sent out for
review.

so "my tree is set for linux-next inclusion" means that, all the stuff
will be merged in linux-next automatically, even if I have not asked
linux-next to pull my changes, right?

sorry for the mistake again.

thanks,
