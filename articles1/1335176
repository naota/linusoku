OK, can you explain why? Is the problem the difference between the two
types of IRQ domain? I would have assumed this was an internal detail of
the driver hence not an issue. I assume there's no issue with
known/static IRQ numbers, since both 0 and -1 end up dynamically
allocating the IRQ bases IIRC.

Hmmm. Perhaps that means regmap_add_irq_chips() should be split into two
parts; one to create all the IRQ chips and hook everything together, and
the second to actually enable the interrupt.
