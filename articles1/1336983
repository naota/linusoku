Sorry, I should clarify what I meant: you'll have a total of one extra
indirection, not two.  You have to follow the pointer to get to both the
size and the buckets.  However, I would *hope* that you'd keep that line
in cache during any repeated activity using that hash table, which ought
to eliminate the cost of the indirection.  Does that line really get
evicted from cache entirely by the time you touch the dcache again?

Seems like avoiding some of the longer paths through the dcache code
would also improve your cache behavior.  But in any case, I can easily
believe that the small L1 cache provides a win.

By that argument, it might make sense to make the L1 cache a closed hash
table and drop the chaining, to get rid of one more indirection, or
several.

Does your two-level dcache handle eviction?

Mind posting the WIP patches?
