Yes, the page_table_lock is close to useless once shared page tables are
involved. It's why if we ever wanted to make shared page tables a core MM
thing we'd have to revisit how PTE locking at any level that can share
page tables works.

In this case it all happens under the hugetlb instantiation mutex in
hugetlb_fault(). It's yet another reason why removing that mutex would
be a serious undertaking and the gain for doing so is marginal.
