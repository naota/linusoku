For nr-gpios, I think it is typically not needed. Generally, you will
know how many gpio lines the h/w has based on the compatible string. If
this part really is the same part but different packages with different
numbers of gpio, then this property makes sense. Otherwise, I would say
drop it.

If your goal is how many gpios are you using, you really need a bitmap
instead if you want it to be generic.

IIRC, Tegra also needed this in that they N instances of some number of
bits and the registers are interleaved so they can't have separate nodes.
