Which db is under the hood doesn't matter much, but those spinlocks got
me thinking.

I was thinking while you're spinning in userspace, you're not giving the
kernel decisions to make.  But you're right.  If they didn't have
spinning locks, they'd have sleeping locks.  With spinning locks they
can be less smart I suppose.
