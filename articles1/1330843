The question was whether we should add those to the long-lived input
interface or not, sorry if that sounded like a rant.

So far, we have provided the baseline of reliable data from similar
devices.

Input properties are not a precious resource, there is no limit on the
bitmask values or anything like that, but there is no rush to add new
ones.

I am interpreting Chase's suggestion as simply reporting the raw
values instead of min/max.

So it seems there is no need to add logic to the driver, only change
one line from min/max to raw data for this particular hardware. That
would solve your problem, yes?

I understand you are not interested in looking into this, and your
main objective is quite clear.

Thanks,
Henrik
