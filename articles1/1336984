IMO the patch is wrong.
Any use of wildcards in include/asm-generic/Kbuild.asm is wrong.

IMO include/asm-generic/Kbuild.asm is for generic header files
that ALL archs can use.

If not ALL archs can use it, then the individual arch shall
specify the file explicit.

I know we here hit a bad thing with the generic-y support,
where we miss a good way to add a file to a lot of archs
without editing a lot of files.
