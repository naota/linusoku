What about devices that come from via though? Anything that first showed up
in vt8500 or earlier should probably get a prefix identifying VIA rather
than WonderMedia.

I have no issue with that.

I am mainly concerned with the Wondermedia products at the moment.

Adding device tree support for WM8505 (and WM8650) is my main goal as the WM8650
currently isn't supported and trying to get another board file added seems unlikely with
everything moving to device tree. The VT8500 requires additional/different patches and
as I don't have a vt8500 I can't test them.

It does raise the question of applying 'wmt, prizm-pmc' to the vt8500 though. While it's
fine for the restart patch I submitted, the vt8500 registers are the same but the bit-fields
are different and therefore not entirely compatible with 'prizm-pmc'.
When it comes to other PMC-related features, in particular the clocks, the VT8500 is quite
different in its bit-fields.

The vt8500 isn't technically in the Prizm family, as that is Wondermedia's name for the SoC's.
