There is only one constellation which will not be able to deliver
randomness via the timer interrupt and a "cycle counter":

Systems, which do not have an usable fine granular clocksource and
therefor are completely based on jiffies. Those systems have neither
high resolution timers nor NOHZ idle for obvious reasons.

Though almost all systems which we care about have a more or less
useful clocksource and register it proper with the core.

So we could do the following in the core code when a clocksource is
registered:

Aside of considering it to handle the timekeeping stuff, which has
different criteria, we could filter out the clocksource with the
highest frequency and provide a function which allows us to access it
for randomness and other purposes. IOW, a generic "get_cycles"
implementation.

Now, if the only available clocksource is jiffies, which is completely
useless, as it gets incremented once per timer interrupt (and there is
no distribution possible due to the lack of NOHZ support) then the
function returns 0 which allows the random code to discard it as a
entropy source.

We might consider to put a low frequency limit into that selection
process as well, but that needs some thought and experimentation.
