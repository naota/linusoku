I haven't wrapped my head around the recoloring functions yet.  I stopped
when I realized that if the child is red, the parent must be black,
but the child might be NULL, in which case the parent could be any color.

But... oh!  I see!  It's not the node being erased, but the node being
grafted.  If it has a red child, then it's part of a virtual 3-node, and
that can be downgraded to a 2-node without requiring any tree rebalancing!

Here's an (untested!) attempt at writing the code.  Be aware that although
I use the same variable names, there are significnt differences in what
they're used for!  In particular, "node" is never chnaged, so there's
no need for "old", and the successor is "child".

The main simplifcation I did was rename "black" to "rebalance", initially
set false, and only set "rebalance = rb_is_black(node)" when necessary.

Given the new variable uses, you could merge the "rebalance" and "parent"
variables, so rebalance = false is implied by parent = NULL.  I'm not
sure the variable saving is worth the code complexity, though.

void rb_erase(struct rb_node * const node, struct rb_root * const root)
{
	struct rb_node *parent;
	struct rb_node *child = node->rb_right;
	struct rb_node *tmp = node->rb_left;
	bool rebalance = false;

	if (!tmp) {
		/* Case 1: node to erase has no more than 1 child (easy!) */
		if (!child) {
			/* Node might be black */
			rebalance = rb_is_black(node);
		} else {
one_child:		/*
			 * Node has a child: it must be black, and the child
			 * must be red.  So promote the child to black, and
			 * no rebalancing needed.
			 */
			child->__rb_parent_color = node->__rb_parent_color;
		}
		parent = tmp = rb_parent(node);	// Hope compiler can CSE
	} else if (!child) {
		/* Still case 1, but this time the child is node->rb_left */
		child = tmp;
		goto one_child;
	} else {
		/*
		 * The node we want to erase has both left and right
		 * children, which makes things difficult.  Let's find the
		 * next node in the tree to have it fill old's position.
		 */
		tmp = child->rb_left;
		if (!tmp) {
			/*
			 * Case 2: Successor is node's right child.
			 *
			 *    (n)          (c)
			 *    / \          / \
			 *  (x) (c)  ->  (x) (z)
			 *        \
			 *        (z)
			 *
			 * Node z may or may not exist.  If it exists, it must

			 */
			tmp = child->rb_right;
			parent = child;
		} else {
			/*
			 * Case 3: Successor is not direct child; it
			 * is the left child of a chain (y) of other

			 *

			do {
				parent = child;
				child = tmp;
				tmp = child->rb_left;
			} while (tmp);

			child->rb_right = tmp = node->rb_right;
			rb_set_parent(tmp, child);
			parent->rb_left = tmp = child->rb_right;
		}
		// Variable usage:
		// "parent" is the bottom of "(y)", which is the same as

		/*
		 * Here there are two cases, just like in case 1.

		 * and its child was red, and can be promoted with no
		 * rebalancing.  If it did not, child might be either
		 * color, and its parent rebalancing if it was black.
		 */
		if (tmp)
			// tmp->__rb_parent_color = child->__rb_parent_color;
			rb_set_parent_color(tmp, parent, RB_BLACK);

I wasn't positive, either, but I figured it was easy enough to delete if
you disagreed.

I did think of one possible simplification: return a pointer to the parent's
child pointer and update that:

	*rb_pptr(old, parent, root) = new;

where

static inline struct rb_node **rb_pptr(struct rb_node *rb, struct rb_node *p,
		struct rb_root *root)
{
	if (!p)
		return &root->rb_node;
	else if (parent->rb_left == node)
		return &parent->rb_left;
	else
		return &parent->rb_right;
}

Ah.  Then I'll stop muttering about ideas that imply major rewrites.

You're the one who spotted the major simplification, but I'm glad
to have been of some minor help.
