Hi Seth,

zcache out of staging is rather controversial as you see this thread.
But I believe zram is very mature and code/comment is clean. In addition,
it has lots of real customers in embedded side so IMHO, it would be easy to
promote it firstly. Of course, it will promote zsmalloc which is half on
what you want. What do you think about? If you agree, could you do that firstly?
If you don't want and promoting zcache continue to be controversial,
I will do that after my vacation.

Thanks.
