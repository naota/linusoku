OK, but - unstaging 'zsmalloc' is a different patchset.

The goal is to support _both_ enterprise and embedded.

But what you are saying sounds like it does not work in enterprise
environment - which is not my experience? If you are saying that
the code should not be integrated before it works in both classes
perfectly - well, then a lot of other code in the Linux should not
have been accepted - and I would call those insufficienies "bugs".
And bugs are .. natural, albeit pesky.

I think what you are saing by "enterprise" is that you want
it to be enabled by default (or at least be confident that it
can be done so) for everybody and that it work quite well under
99% workload. While right now it covers only 98% (or some
other number) of workload.

Ok, so zbud rewrite is to remove the need for zsmalloc
and use zbud2 for both persistent and ephemeral pages.

This sounds like a Catch-22 :-) Greg would like to have the
TODO list finished - and it seems that one of the todo's
is to have one instead of two engines for dealing with pages.
But at the same time not adding in new features.

So in short you made zcache more modular?

Sure. Thought you could do it more wholesale: sysfs->debugfs patch.

You are ignoring the goodness of the testing and performance
numbers that zcache has gotten so far. With a new code those
numbers are invalidated. That is throwing away some good data.
Reviewing code based on the old code (and knowing how the
old code works) I think is easier than trying to understand new
code from scratch - at least one has a baseline to undertand it.
But that might be just my opinion - either way I am OK
looking at brand new code or old code - but I would end up
looking at the old code to answer those : "Huh. I wonder how
we did that previously." - at which point it might make sense
just to have the patches broken up in small segments.

So we agree that it must be fixed, but disagree on how to fix it :-)

However there are real folks in the embedded env that use it (with
some modifications) - please don't call them "unreal users".

So in my head I feel that it is Ok to:
1) address the concerns that zcache has before it is unstaged
2) rip out the two-engine system with a one-engine system
   (and see how well it behaves)
3) sysfs->debugfs as needed
4) other things as needed

I think we are getting hung-up what Greg said about adding features
and the two-engine->one engine could be understood as that.
While I think that is part of a staging effort to clean up the
existing issues. Lets see what Greg thinks.
