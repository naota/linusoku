FWIW, I'm all for performance backports.  They do have a downside though
(other than the risk of bugs slipping in, or triggering latent bugs).

When the next enterprise kernel is built, marketeers ask for numbers to
make potential customers drool over, and you _can't produce any_ because
you wedged all the spiffy performance stuff into the crusty old kernel.
