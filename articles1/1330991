OK, that might be true in fact.
I disassembled that device recently (and did quite a bit of work),
so perhaps the touchpad connection isn't as reliable as I'd want it to
be...


Problem is that now (and some other times, too) S2R resume
ended up with a dead x.org keyboard (synaptics i.e. mouse pointer
was still working fine).
Remote login was ok.

In dmesg, I found:

[   13.694115] atkbd serio0: Spurious NAK on isa0060/serio0. Some
program might be trying to access hardware directly.

and then

[ 8278.484469] atkbd serio0: Spurious ACK on isa0060/serio0. Some
program might be trying to access hardware directly.

which is the one that occurred around the time of the S2R breakage.
I then triggered a remote pm-suspend,
and after S2R keyboard WAS FINE AGAIN, with NO dmesg error logged this
time!!

Don't tell me we've got a "short intermittent hardware failure on resume
leads to final hardware unusability" issue here ;-)

Anything to gather debug information when it happens again?
Perhaps some event helper tools or some such?

Xorg.0.log does not show any keyboard / input(keyboard) lines
in the whole interesting time range (only a ton of synaptics messages).

OTOH I remember some very recent work on x.org synaptics driver resume
behaviour, maybe that was done to fix such keyboard cases...

Thanks,

Andreas Mohr
