There are two reasons for not doing this:

1. it is wrong to force core optional features on by using 'select'
2. it is wrong to use 'select' on user visible symbols because it creates
   confusion, and prevents the user from disabling the option.

Note that highmem is just a hack to make larger memory systems work before
64-bit systems happen - it is _known_ to make systems unstable with large
amounts of highmem (even on x86) due to the requirement to have a certain
amount of metadata stored in lowmem.

Nothing should ever force anyone to have highmem enabled.

I still fail to see how not having highmem enabled would ever cause memory
corruption errors (unless something dealing with memory in a very very
wrong way - iow, not using one of the reservation or memory allocation
methods provided by the kernel.)
