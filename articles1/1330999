/me finds Doug isn't actually on the CC, /me fixes.

Doug had this web-page with all his testing activities, graphs and code
etc..

  http://www.smythies.com/~doug/network/load_average/

Seems to still work.

Last time I tried his scripts they weren't very user friendly, and afaik
he's making the pretty graphs 'manually'. But whatever he's got is there
I think.

If someone wants to take it and make it pretty and 'usable' for people
in a hurry I'm sure Doug wouldn't mind.
