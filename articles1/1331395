regulator: Updates for 3.6

Lots and lots of fixes from Axel and some others here, plus some framework
enhancements which continue the theme of factoring code out of the drivers
and into the core.

- Initial framework support for GPIO controlled enable signals, saving a
  bunch of code in drivers.
- Move fixed regulator enable time and voltage mapping table
  specifications to data.
- Used some of the recent framework enhancements to make voltage change
  notifications more useful, passing the voltage in as an argument to the
  notification.
- Fixed the pattern used for finding individual regulators on a device
  to not rely on the node name, supporting the use of multiple PMICs of
  the same type in the system.
- New drivers for Maxim MAX77686, TI LP872x and LP8788, Samsung S2MPS11,
  and Wolfson Arizona microphone supplies and LDOs.
