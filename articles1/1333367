Thank you very much for taking the time to look into this.

/dev/sda1 is the root filesystem.  The writes were most likely by MySQL, 
but I would have to run iotop to be sure.

After rebooting, MythTV is currently recording two shows, and the resync 
is running at full speed.

# cat /proc/mdstat

atop shows the avio of all the drives to be less than 1ms, where before 
they were much higher.  It will run for a couple days under load just 
fine, and then it will come to a halt.

It's a 3.2.21 kernel.  I'm running Debian Testing, and the exact Debian 
package version is:

ii  linux-image-3.2.0-3-686-pae                    
3.2.21-3                                       Linux 3.2 for modern PCs

This is not a scheduled check.  It was triggered by, I believe, an 
unclean shutdown.  An unclean shutdown will trigger a resync.  I don't 
think it used to do this, but I could be remembering wrong.

I will try lowering those numbers next time this happens, which will 
probably be within the next day or two.  That's about how often this 
happens.
