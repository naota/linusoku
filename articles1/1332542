Well, the trouble with bindings is that they are much harder to change
later, at least in incompatible ways.

We have the same problem for a lot of other subsystems: clock, regulator,
irq, gpio, pinctrl, dma, ...

In each of these cases, we want a driver to be able to associate some
property with a driver (or platform code) from another subsystem.
We try to handle those using generic subsystem code that interprets
regular property names.

The generic binding would only need to specify what the property
looks like and how the possible values can be determined. We don't
need to make that code generic right away but could wait until we
have a couple of implementations before we pull out the common bits.

The important part to me is writing the binding in a way that allows
us to do this.

I had never seen the hwmod binding before and if I had I would have
given them the same comments. I definitely don't think we should be
using it as a good example for common code.

Well, it does mean that we need to maintain a separate binding document
for each soc that has its own set of possible values.

The part that matches the pm-domain device nodes can and should be
specific to the platform implementing the pm-domain. We can easily
do the same thing we did for regulators, where each regulator can
be either identified through its "reg" property in cases where that
makes sense or through a "regulator-compatible" property in cases
where we need a string representation.
