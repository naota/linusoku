Not sure if you are talking about couple idle series waiting in Len's tree for
the merge.

That series actually trying add infrastructure for the hardwares
where CPU's need co-ordination which is needed on few ARM hardwares
to get into deeper CPU cluster C-states. It is indeed true that without
that approach, cpu-hotplug was used to overcome the ordering issue
I guess Exynos, Tegra and OMAP are the few ARM architectures I
know who has been using the couple cpuidle infrastructure.
