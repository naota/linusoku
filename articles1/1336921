Oh, thats really a bad mistake from my side. I apologize.

Right.

But uprobe_mmap() still needs to walk thro the probe list and 
insert the other probes. Currently we just ignore the remaining probes
and that has to be fixed within uprobe_mmap.

Agree.

How about having your fix + my patch to fix the uprobe_mmap()?
