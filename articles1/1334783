That would work and I like this solution the best, but I'm not familiar 
enough with i915 to comment on how feasible it is or implement it. It 
should even be possible to switch the DDC mux first, let i915 do the 
detection and switch the display later to avoid long black screens.

Not sure about it, but it might be because vga_default_device is wrong 
if you switch the mux manually.

Just as a sidenote, I tested running two X server and it does work as 
expected.
