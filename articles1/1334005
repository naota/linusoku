It rebuilt fine in single user mode, with speeds usually around 
50MB/sec.  But after exiting single user mode, and allowing MythTV and 
other programs to start, within 30 minutes I had the problem again.  
Basically a hung filesystem.  I couldn't even "cat /proc/mdstat", that 
just hung.  Lots of hung task warnings in dmesg.

Because Phil suggested that fsync calls might cause stalls, I commented 
out the fsync in MythTV.  I'll run with that for awhile, and see how 
things work out.  So far it isn't adversely affecting MythTV.

Thanks!
