There are two cases.

1) They're using GPL-exported symbols in a module that they're trying to 
claim is not licensed under the GPL.  In this case someone with suitable 
copyright standing could talk to them and get them to release the code 
or rewrite it to not depend on GPL-only symbols.

2) You want to use their code under the GPL.  In this case you should 
probably talk to your legal people.  If you released the code under the 
GPL and they sued you for it you might be able to argue that that 
statement implies that the module is licensed under the GPL.   But it 
might be an expensive argument.
