What about something like the following structure, from the OMAP3 ISP driver ?

struct omap3isp_prev_update_config {
        __u32 update;
        __u32 flag;
        __u32 shading_shift;
        struct omap3isp_prev_luma __user *luma;
        struct omap3isp_prev_hmed __user *hmed;
        struct omap3isp_prev_cfa __user *cfa;
        struct omap3isp_prev_csup __user *csup;
        struct omap3isp_prev_wbal __user *wbal;
        struct omap3isp_prev_blkadj __user *blkadj;
        struct omap3isp_prev_rgbtorgb __user *rgb2rgb;
        struct omap3isp_prev_csc __user *csc;
        struct omap3isp_prev_yclimit __user *yclimit;
        struct omap3isp_prev_dcor __user *dcor;
        struct omap3isp_prev_nf __user *nf;
        struct omap3isp_prev_gtables __user *gamma;
};

I'll probably have more comments when I'll see the complete list of parameters 
you need to expose.
