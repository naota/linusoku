There's a tool that enables some verbose logging which records all the
I/O to the gmux. It works for me with a Macbook Pro 8,2 running OS X
Lion, so you might give it a try.

All you need to do is clone https://github.com/ah-/switcher.git, build,
and run switcher. If it works you'll see messages prefixed with AGC in
dmesg. Then you can use gfxCardStatus to force some switches between the
integrated and discrete cards. After that you'll want to grab
/var/log/kern.log to get the full logs of everything that happened.

If you try this and it works, I'd appreciate it if you could send me a
copy of kern.log so I can apply the information towards getting graphics
switching into apple-gmux.
