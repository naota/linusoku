This would mean that we have to go round every single driver that
doesn't have physical wake support and add a setting for the wake
registers (which seems pointless given that the core can just as well
figure this out from the fact that it's not had any wake registers
specified) and we then have to add special cases for this in the core
code.  This doesn't seem like great API design, it's not conveneint for
either side of the interface and it's error prone.

IIRC it does actually do this, I'd need to check though.
