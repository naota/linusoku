Heh!!!  The number of underscores for the original rcu_dereference()'s
local variable was the outcome of an argument about how obfuscated that
variable's name should be in order to avoid possible collisions with names
in the enclosing scope.  Nine leading underscores might seem excessive,
or even as you say, insane, but on the other hand no name collisions
have ever come to my attention.  ;-)
