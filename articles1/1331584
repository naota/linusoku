Yes. It's not static.

I'm not against you strongly but IMHO, putback_balloon_page is never generic
function which is likely to be used by many others so I hope not overdesign.

I don't like that.
PageLRU isn't likelihood case in this.

No problem. But the concern is that I can't agree this patch implementation.

I mean just do
put_page(page); /* blah blah */
put_page(page); /* It will free the page to buddy */

Yeb it's more fat than __free_page for your case. If so, please comment write out
why you use __free_page instead of put_page.

/*
 * balloon page should be never compund page and not on the LRU so we

But it is adding a few hooks to generic functions which all assume they
are LRU pages. Although it's trivial for performance, we don't need get
such loss due to very infrequent event.

More concern to me that it makes code complicated because we assume
functions related migration/compaction depend on LRU pages.
Let me say a example.
suitable_migration_target in isolate_freepages returns true pageblock
type is MIGRATE_MOVABLE or MIGRATE_CMA which expect pages in that block
is migratable so they should be moved into another location or reclaimed
if we have no space for getting big contiguos space.
All of such code should consider balloon page but balloon page can't be
reclaimed unlike normal LRU page so it makes design more complex.

Look at memory-hotplug, offline_page calls has_unmovable_pages, scan_lru_pages
and do_migrate_range which calls isolate_lru_page. They consider only LRU pages
to migratable ones.

IMHO, better approach is that after we can get complete free pageblocks
by compaction or reclaim, move balloon pages into that pageblocks and make
that blocks to unmovable. It can prevent fragmentation and it makes
current or future code don't need to consider balloon page.

Of course, it needs more code but I think it's valuable.
What do you think about it?
