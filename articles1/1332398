I have measured acpi_pr_<level>() to make sure my statement is correct.
Here are the results:

Avg. acpi_get_name()		 587 ns
Avg. printk()			3420 ns
Avg. kfree()			 238 ns
Avg. acpi_get_time()+kfree()	 825 ns

The results indicate that acpi_pr_<level>() has 20% increase of the time
compared to the regular printk(), which is less than 1 us.  I believe
the results endorse my statement, and may not cause any performance
issue to the error paths of the ACPI drivers.
