Hold on, that is rather unfair. The zcache has been in staging
for quite some time - your code has not been posted. Part of
"unstaging" a driver is for folks to review the code - and you
just said "No, mine is better" without showing your goods.

There is a third option - which is to continue the promotion
of zcache from staging, get reviews, work on them ,etc, and
alongside of that you can work on fixing up (or ripping out)
zcache1 with zcache2 components as they make sense. Or even
having two of them - an enterprise and an embedded version
that will eventually get merged together. There is nothing
wrong with modifying a driver once it has left staging.
