Could you point out specific patches you mentiond which makes kswapd/compaction
smart? It will make description very clear.

I support it because I had a concern about that flags which is likely to be
used by other subsystems without careful thinking when the flag was introduced.
It's proved by mtd_kmalloc_up_to which was merged with sneaking without catching
from mm guys's eyes. When I read comment of that function, it seems to be proper
usage but I don't like it because it requries users of mm to know mm internal
like kswapd. So it should be avoided if possible.

Plus, it means you need to fix it with show_gfp_flags. :)

Yes. it should be very careful.
I guess Mel and Andrea would have opinions and benchmark.
