So 3/4, 4/4 are racy and I think you convinced me it's best to drop it for
now. I hope that fact that we already scan all vcpus under spinlock for
level interrupts is enough to justify adding a lock here.

To summarize issues still outstanding with 1/2, 2/2:
- source id lingering after irqfd was destroyed/deassigned
  prevents assigning a new irqfd
- if same irqfd is deassigned and re-assigned, this
  seems to succeed but does not give any more EOIs
- document that user needs to re-inject interrupts
  injected by level IRQFD after migration as they are cleared

Hope this helps!
