Ben,

I see your point. I have cleaned up the contents of the KVP produced
configuration file to not include constant information that can be
auto generated by the distro specific script if it needs to. Also, I have
tried to make the documentation of the contents of the file a little
better. I will send out these new patches soon. Still, there is a possibility that
some of the content of this file may be redundant on a specific distro and I think
that should be fine. For instance, per Olaf's suggestion, I have included a line that
specifies the interface name in the file (in addition to the mac address). Given the
current format of the name of the config file (where the interface name is embedded
in the config file name, this additional name entry may be redundant on some distros.

Once again, thank you for taking the time to review this code.

Regards,

K. Y
