Please don't even consider doing something like this. As we continue to develop and maintain the ACPICA code, these kinds of OS-specific divergences from the base ACPICA code cause us all kinds of grief, including the accidental creation of new bugs as it becomes more and more difficult to integrate the base ACPICA code back into Linux.

In fact, we have a major project this year (and probably far into next year) to continue to minimize (i.e., fix) this type of Linux/ACPICA divergence -- of which many have crept in over the years that ACPICA has been present in the Linux kernel.
