I'd never heard of Andre until reading this as I'm not a dev.  If he'd
died in an auto accident I wouldn't be typing this.

I think we dishonor Andre's memory and do a disservice to other
technical folks by avoiding the subject of 'why'.  Or has this been
discussed and I'm simply unaware?  He apparently made a decent living a=
t
Cisco, had a wife and 4 kids, a prototypical nice life.  So why did he
end it?  Pressure/stress, bipolar disorder, depression?

He's not the first super talented tech to take his own life, and won't
be the last.  If we continue to shove "why" under the rug there's littl=
e
chance of preventing another friend/colleague from doing the same in th=
e
future.

If those who knew him well would talk about the 'why' that just might
raise awareness and maybe help save a life down the road.  Then again
maybe no devs actually got to really know the man.
