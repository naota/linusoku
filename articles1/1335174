OK, so more like how the max8907.c patch I posted did it than the
pre-existing arizona.c that I converted did it.

I had implemented this in regmap since you'd specifically mentioned
doing that. If I convert the code not to use separate IRQ domains for
this, would that be acceptable?

Hmmm. I actually don't see any pm_*() usage in regmap right now. I
assume this /is/ needed to convert arizona.c, since it's making these
calls today. I don't need it for max8907.c. Should I add another flag to
regmap_add_irq_chips() indicating whether this is needed, or ...?
