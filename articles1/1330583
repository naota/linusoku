Presumably, Hyper-V can deal with unexpected values here, no?  Otherwise, it 
wouldn't be future proof against new types of guests.

So worst case scenario, Hyper-V disables optimizations on Linux guests that 
report then new ID until they patch Hyper-V to know about the new ID.

That seems like a reasonable trade off to me.  I'm sure there's sufficient 
incentive to patch Hyper-V for this at Microsoft...
