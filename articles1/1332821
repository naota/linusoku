The prevoius discussion happend on kvm-devel; it was suggested then to
use virtio-serial for that as well.  We don't have an in-kernel
interface for communication yet (barring the console interface, which
we don't want to re-use for other reasons).

Writing the in-kernel interface for communication with the host is not
too much work as well.

I agree using virtio-serial for several such free-form message-passing
between the guest and host is the right way to implement such stuff.

The lack of dedicated devices over either virtio or emulation of
real hardware can be overcome by adding some documentation -
preferably to the virtio spec's appendix, showing how watchdogs, etc.,
are implemented using virtio-serial.
