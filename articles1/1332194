Actually I meant OS-level virtualization (no hypervisors) based on the 
linux cgroup subsystem and namespaces like OpenVZ or LXC . Although the 
latter does not have the container migration ability at present, there 
is a project that will hopefully allow this soon (criu.org). For such 
virtualization systems, per-kernel option would be enough because all 
guests share the same kernel.

I guess that when the more advanced features become widely-used, vendors 
will offer new MSRs and/or CPUID faulting.
