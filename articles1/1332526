Right, which means that it's not generic and we still need to make
a decision for a how we want to solve the underlying problem. The
options I see are:

1. Have no earlyprintk before loading the console drivers
2. Make the series from Domenico architecture independent code
3. Reimplement a layer like that, differently
4. Make it a compile-time option and allow this only for
   low level debugging purposes but disable it in distro kernels.
