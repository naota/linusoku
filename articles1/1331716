Just so you know, there was a ceremonial gong when it happened.

I can live with that :) It would not be the first time we found the right
patch out of dislike for the first proposed and getting the fix is what's
important.

That's a reasonable objection. The trylock could be avoided by always
falling through at the cost of reducing the amount of sharing
opportunities but the nested locking is unavoidable. I agree with you
that nested locking like this should always be a cause for concern.

It certainly helps in the shmdt case which is what the test case focused
on because that is what the application that triggered this bug was
doing. However, you're right in that the exit_mmap() path is still vunerable
because it does not take mmap_sem. I'll think about that a bit more.

I like it in that it's simple and I can confirm it works for the test case
of interest.

However, is your patch not vunerable to truncate issues?
madvise()/truncate() issues was the main reason why I was wary of VMA tricks
as a solution. As it turns out, madvise(DONTNEED) is not a problem as it is
ignored for hugetlbfs but I think truncate is still problematic. Lets say
we mmap(MAP_SHARED) a hugetlbfs file and then truncate for whatever reason.

invalidate_inode_pages2
  invalidate_inode_pages2_range
    unmap_mapping_range_vma
      zap_page_range_single
        unmap_single_vma
	  __unmap_hugepage_range (removes VM_MAYSHARE)

The VMA still exists so the consequences for this would be varied but
minimally fault is going to be "interesting".

I think that potentially we could work around this but it may end up stomping
on the core MM and not necessarily be any better than Michal's patch.

I'm fine with the second part.
