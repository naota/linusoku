I do not believe rounding is documented anywhere; the rates are
mentioned in kbdrate manpage.

Frankly at this time I'd just leave this all as is since there were no
complaints from users about repeat rates on keyboards and most clients
(X) implement their own, software-based, rate control.

I do not think it is that obvious to anyone who is not living in the US.
The only reason I paid attention to the name is I recognized your e-mail
from LKML as one never signing your name.

I am not sure whether common law countries allow anyone pick any name of
their choosing and use it as their legal name; I know that we had to
refuse submission from another developer wishing to use a pen name
(HDAPS driver).

Luckily we are using software based repeat on USB (and most other input
devices).

No, I do not think it's worth it as we have software-based repeat
implementation that allows arbitrary rates.

Thanks.
