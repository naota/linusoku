The single issue virtio-nic solves is performance enhancements that can 
be done w/ a fully emulated NIC. The reason is that such NIC tend to 
access pio/mmio space a lot while virtio is designed for virtualization.

Standard watchdog device (isn't it time you'll try qemu?)  isn't about 
performance and if that's all the functionality you need it should work 
fine.

btw: check the virtio-trace series that was just send in a parallel thread.
