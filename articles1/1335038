I think the first 3 patches should be merged (if VFS people are OK with
them of course) first to make the rest of the work easier.

How does this tests that the accounting is correct? I would expect
something that would exercise dirty vs. writeback and having 0 in the
end. with your 24G memcg and 1G IO you do not see any memcg effects
(only the global ones). Have you tested with something like 20M group and
pushing 1G data through it?

Yes, this is exactly what I had in mind when I asked about the overhead
when memcg are not in use last time (mentioning jump labels or how they
are called at the moment).

I think it is a must before merging. We do not want an infrastructure
that is not used currently and which brings an overhead.
Anyway, this is a good start for the future work. Thanks for doing that!
