Because the secure side does not have virtualisation extensions so you
won't be able to run something like KVM.

That's not meant to be an official document for SoC designers. It just
states the requirements from the Linux kernel perspective. But ARM is
producing platform design documents covering hardware and firmware
requirements and these will be made available.

In short, AArch64 (unlike previously) comes at EL3 out of reset. You
will have firmware running here doing hardware various initialisation
and initialise the secure software if there is one. It then gives
control to the non-secure side (can be UEFI, some boot loader, Linux
etc).
