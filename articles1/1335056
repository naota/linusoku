Is anything actually doing this?  For positive numbers that just seems
like it's asking for things to explode, for negative numbers I guess you
can get away with it at the minute though it's obviously not awesome
error handling.

TBH I'd actually expect that gpio_is_valid() were checking that there's
a gpio_chip behind the GPIO number, now I look at the implementation
it's very surprising to me that it's just checking the GPIO array bounds
(and also that we remove the need for the fixed size GPIO array which is
just an endless source of annoyance).
